# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfic ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

Right now I know how to create dialog, so the mod currently has a few extra dialog options in existing conversations and 2 new conversations. 

### Big steps to take are:
* recording info about the player activating cheats and the game profile to incorporate into the story
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character appearances
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters
