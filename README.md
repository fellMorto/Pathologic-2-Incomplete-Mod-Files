# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfic ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

Right now I know how to create dialog, so the mod currently has a few extra dialog options in existing conversations and 2 new conversations. 

### Goal of this mod:
The main idea for this mod came from the difference I felt playing a cheat/noncheat run. I wanted to incorporate this difference into the story. I also wanted to incorporate more folklore and mythology into the story, and insert my fanfiction backstory for Artemy. Most of these goals aren't really implemented at this point, and for now I've just inserted some fanfiction conversation ideas I had.

### Big steps to take are:
* recording info about the player activating cheats and the game profile to incorporate into the story
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character spawns
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters

### Notes:
* The only dll code file with any changes is **VirtualMachine.Common.**
*  In PathologicSandbox parameter.xml, there's a parameter called Wolf which changes a lot of the new dialog options. In the mod it's set as True so that's the options that will appear.
