# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfic ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

Right now I know how to create dialog, so the mod currently has a few extra dialog options in existing conversations and a few new conversations. 

### Goal of this mod:
The main idea for this mod came from the difference I felt playing a cheat/noncheat run. I wanted to incorporate this difference into the story. I also wanted to incorporate folklore into the story, and insert my fanfiction backstory for Artemy. Wolves also come up a lot. 

But most of these goals aren't really implemented at this point, and for now I've just inserted some conversation ideas I had.

### Big steps to take are:
* recording info about the player activating cheats and the game profile to incorporate into the story
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character spawns
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters

### Notes:
* The only dll code file with any changes is **VirtualMachine.Common**
*  In PathologicSandbox parameter.xml, there's a parameter called Wolf which affects a lot of the new dialog options
