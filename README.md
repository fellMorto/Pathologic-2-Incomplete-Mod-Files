# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

### Working Mod Title: Pathologic 2: Chono Hun

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfic ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

Right now I know how to create dialog, so the mod currently has a few extra dialog options in existing conversations and a few new conversations. 

### Goal of this mod:
The main idea for this mod came from the difference I felt playing a cheat/noncheat run. This mod records if intended difficulty is turned off, and reflects that in some story changes. I've also added some new dialog ideas I had.

I also wanted to incorporate folklore into the story, and insert my fanfiction backstory for Artemy. Wolves are also thematically important and come up alot.

But it's mostly incomplete at this point, and for now I've just inserted some conversation ideas I had.

### Big steps to take are:
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character spawns
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters

### Notes:
* If Intended Difficulty is turned off for the game profile, this should change the mod content. It might not reflect in currently existing profiles with Intended Difficulty off.
* The only dll code file with any changes are **VirtualMachine.Common.dll** and **Assembly-CSharp.dll**
