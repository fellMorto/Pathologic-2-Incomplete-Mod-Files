# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

### Working Mod Title: Pathologic 2 - Chono Hun

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfiction ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

### Goal of this mod:
The main idea for this mod came from the difference I felt playing a cheat/noncheat run. This mod records if Intended Difficulty is turned off, and reflects that in some story changes. I've also added some new dialog ideas I had.

I also wanted to incorporate new folklore into the story, and insert my fanfiction backstory for Artemy. Wolves are also thematically important and come up alot. This is honestly kind of a furry mod, and I apologize for that.

But it's mostly incomplete at this point, and for now I've just inserted some conversation ideas I had.

### Notes:
* This mod content should appear if you replace the VirtualMachine and dll files
  * VirtualMachine at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Data
  * dll files at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Pathologic_Data\Managed
* The only dll code file with any changes are **VirtualMachine.Common.dll** and **Assembly-CSharp.dll**
* Content appearing in existing profiles is hit or miss, and the mod currently only records cheats turned on for a new profile
* Profiles are permanently altered if Intended Difficulty is ever turned off
