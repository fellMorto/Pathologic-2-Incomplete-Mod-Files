### Mod Title: Pathologic 2 - Chono-Hün

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfiction ideas into game scenarios.

The main addition of this mod is Diurunal bad ending variant dialogs if you turn off Intended Difficulty, plus minor new dialogs in general. 

Wolves are also thematically important, and come up a lot.

### How to Download:
* This mod contains VirtualMachine files and dll files
* The content should appear if you replace the original files
* You can navigate to the Pathologic 2 files from Steam. Right click Pathologic 2 -> Manage -> Browse Local Files
  * VirtualMachine files at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Data\VirtualMachine
    *  From Pathologic 2 files, go to **Data** then **VirtualMachine**
  * There are three VirtualMachine folders to replace.
    * **PathologicSandbox**
    * **PathologicPlagueIntro**
    * **PathologicHaruspexIntro**
    * MarbleNest doesn't have any changes. Just leave this folder if you have it.
  * dll files at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Pathologic_Data\Managed
    * From Pathologic 2 files, go to **Pathologic_Data** then **Managed**
  * Just replace the two dll files and leave the rest
    * **VirtualMachine.Common.dll**
    * **Assembly-CSharp.dll**
### Notes:
* Content appearing in existing profiles is hit or miss, and I believe the mod only records cheats turned on for a new profile
* Profiles are permanently altered if Intended Difficulty is ever turned off. Make sure Intended Difficulty is on from the beginning
* Reinstalling the game will reset the files back to base game
