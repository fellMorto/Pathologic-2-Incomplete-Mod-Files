# Pathologic-2-Incomplete-Mod-Files

### Mod Title: Pathologic 2 - Chono Hun

This is basically a mod trying to incorporate my fanfiction ideas into game scenarios. It's in a very incomplete, uncohesive state right now. 

The main addition of this mod is a Diurnal bad ending variant if you turn off Intended Difficulty, plus minor new dialogs. Wolves also come up a lot (this is honestly kind of a furry autism mod).

### Notes:
* This mod content should appear if you replace the VirtualMachine and dll files
  * VirtualMachine at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Data
  * dll files at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathologic\Pathologic_Data\Managed
* The only dll code file with any changes are **VirtualMachine.Common.dll** and **Assembly-CSharp.dll**
* Content appearing in existing profiles is hit or miss, and the mod currently only records cheats turned on for a new profile
* Profiles are permanently altered if Intended Difficulty is ever turned off
