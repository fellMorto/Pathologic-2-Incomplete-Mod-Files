# SPOILERS

This should be treated as an internal design document. People playing can read this though, especially to explain unfinished content ideas they can’t learn otherwise.

Again, this is a very spoiler heavy document. These spoilers don’t fit with the intended plot flow and desired obscurity of the mod story for players.

## Explaining the added story 

There are supposed to be two equally likely explanations for what’s happening. 
1. Artemy is mentally ill and going insane
2. Artemy is possessed by a demon wolf

Most of this document focuses on explaining **point 2**, but **point 1** makes more sense and can be imagined as an alternative explanation for basically everything written here.

**Note: Most of the explanations here are undiscoverable in the current unfinished version of the mod, and still might not be shown in a final version of the mod. For now, these are mostly external explanations with no implementation.**
## New backstory

This mod has a new fanfiction backstory for Artemy, where he is a reincarnation of the new OC wolf Buri.
Buri was a wolf found and raised by Ersher (Artemy’s brother who died at a young age). Because Ersher was sickly, Buri decided to find him the magical cure of a Tenerife-nokhoin heart. Tengri-nokhoin are folkloric wolves who live to a thousand years, and whose organs have special properties in traditional Kin medicine. Buri instead stumbles across a rabid fox who claims to be a thousand years old. It convinces Buri to kill and eat it, infecting them with rabies as well. 

This gives Buri a vision of how to age their own heart a thousand years to give to Ersher, using the red strings of fate. The red strings are Bos Turokhs’s veins in folklore, and represent all time and possible timelines. Buri sees a spot in town where these red strings can partially manifest in the physical world. Buri goes to this spot, digs themself into the earth, and dies from rabies. This spot is where the cathedral is built later in time, so the presence of the red strings is why time is affected by the cathedral. 

This action causes Buri to physically die, but their “soul” to continue existing ensnared in the red strings. The red strings basically gives Buri’s soul the ability to traverse time, and theoretically let them age their soul a thousand years. However, Buri enters a dream state and isn’t able to consciously guide themselves. Buri then reincarnates into Artemy.  Artemy grows up unaware of his past life, and Buri is mostly silent. Ersher dies soon after Artemy is born.

The backstory also adds that Artemy attempted suicide 5 years before the present, shortly before the first Outbreak, which was a contributing factor to him being sent away. The mod itself won’t really give an explanation for this, beyond having parallels to the new diurnal bad end.
## Buri/Artemy

Buri and Artemy aren’t really connected in a clear way. The main explanation is that Buri is dreaming of their reincarnated life as Artemy. Buri is the original soul that can dream themselves into different reincarnated lives. They may be more or less aware of their nature due to being in a dreamlike state. Buri and Artemy appear both as separate characters and simultaneous dialog options for the player. Their relationship can be described various different ways, with none being perfect explanations:
- Artemy is possessed by Buri
- Artemy is Buri’s dream avatar
- Artemy and Buri are different life-states of a soul which is in the process of transitioning between the two

## In-game events

**Note: The Buri character hasn’t been implemented yet, and a lot of this information can’t be discovered in the mod right now.**

The initial game sequence of the army slaughtering everyone is the original timeline. Artemy’s failure to address the outbreak is so jarring and traumatic that it shocks the “Buri” aspect of his persona to become more lucid. Buri decides to tear the string of fate containing this timeline, destroying it so time goes back to the train ride into town. The game is then Artemy rebuilding that block of time through his actions and trying to find a different outcome. Also, depending on certain factors, Buri may appear and possess Artemy more or less.
## In-game mechanic explanations

Buri is meant to be closer to a player stand-in character. The ability to save/load is meant to come from Buri’s ability to see and traverse the red strings of time. Buri, like the player, is self-aware about seeing the future when they reload a save, which is reflected in a couple dialogs being affected by reloading a scene.

The ability to activate cheats is meant to be Buri possessing Artemy’s body. It’s supposed to be analogous to how fluid someone’s body can be in a dream, and also to a werewolf transformation where Artemy becomes supernaturally strong.

Activating cheats will also cause Buri to manifest more, and Buri dialog options to appear. These include dialog that’s **bolded** and dialog in …{bracketed format.}

The **bold** represents Buri overriding Artemy’s decisions. Buri often chooses violent or abrasive actions. This is meant to still be Artemy speaking, but with a harsh tone.

The …{brackets} represent Buri speaking. Buri is meant to have a similar personality to Artemy, but more muted. Buri also has meta awareness and can allude to their connection to earth or awareness of the future. This isn’t really Artemy speaking - it’s like a voice of the earth that only some people can hear or understand.

If cheats aren’t activated, Buri will be silent and won’t possess Artemy so obviously. Activating cheats represents Buri/Artemy accepting they aren't human.

## Diurnal normal ending (no cheats)

In the normal diurnal ending, it’s implied that Buri fully reincarnated into a human as Artemy. The actual content won’t be changed much.

## Diurnal variant ending (cheats)

This is meant to be a bad ending. If cheats are activated, Buri will actively possess Artemy. Since Buri is an earth creature and Artemy is only their dream avatar, they will die along with the earth in the diurnal ending. Then, the diurnal ending will be Buri silently viewing the results of this new timeline before disappearing. However, it’s explained that Buri/Artemy’s actions are irrelevant, because they will literally be erased from time and the timeline to this point will be reconstructed in a way that doesn’t require their presence at all. Buri/Artemy then wanders into the steppe and dies.

## Nocturnal ending

As an earth spirit, Buri lives in the nocturnal ending. It’s implied that they’ll continue the cycle of reincarnation. The actual content won’t be changed much.
