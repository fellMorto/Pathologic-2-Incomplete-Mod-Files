6192355001750751 Daniil Dankovsky, the Bachelor
6192355001750777 The Executor
6192355001750778 How am I brave?
6192355001750779 Time to say goodbye? Why so soon?
6192355001750780 That's rather unkind of you. My courage never faltered in the first place.
6192355001750781 You are a brave man, doctor. I'm glad to see you've finally mustered up the courage to do it. Meaning it's probably time to say goodbye, right?
6192355001750782 I'm a doctor. I've been fighting death my whole life. And I usually succeed.
6192355001750783 I don't know... What is proper when dealing with death? Punching its sorry bony face seems like the best option.
6192355001750784 Well, you are going to die now. Death is awaiting you downstairs, by the exit.\nI wonder if you'll manage to give it the proper answer this time.
6192355001750785 My plans were disrupted by a freak accident. If only I could re-live this bloody day...
6192355001750786 What are you driving at?
6192355001750787 I can still fix it!
6192355001750788 You are a great doctor, there's no denying that. A skilled fighter of death. The plague almost devoured this town, but you managed to protect the Stone Yard from the infection, creating an impenetrable citadel here. But take a peek outside—and you'll see that people are still dying. Why do you reckon that is?
6192355001750789 I usually succeed. I'm not used to defeat.
6192355001750790 Can you even exit this house? I'm not sure if you can.
6192355001750791 I understand the nature of death wrong? I'll have you know that I'm a thanatologist—and one of the best in the world, at that. Very few people in this valley of tears know more about death than I do.
6192355001750792 You're claiming to be non-human, I gather?
6192355001750793 You understand the nature of death wrong. You're even using the very word wrong. You people are bad at dying.
6192355001750794 Seeing and even touching death is my job. I'm used to it. And habits desensitize emotion.
6192355001750795 I'd rather kill it.
6192355001750796 How many times do I have to repeat myself? There is a staggering difference between you and me. I fear no death. You, it awaits at the exit.\nYou'll get a chance to take a look at it... touch it even. And then you will cease to be, I suppose.
6192355001750797 Are you suggesting I choose a more manageable foe? No. This is not my style.
6192355001750798 I'm tired of your steppe poetry. Let me through, please.
6192355001750799 Yes. I want to exterminate death. And I'll do just that, rest assured.
6192355001750800 You made a mistake. Fought the wrong enemy. What do I have to do to get through to you...\nYou want to exterminate death, yet you drag it behind like a tethered bull. That's just... not the right way.
6192355001750801 Any Saturday is followed by a Sunday.
6192355001750802 It's not over yet. I can turn it good still.
6192355001750803 Let it wait. I'm in no hurry.
6192355001750804 Farewell, doctor. You were a good man, but your eyes were stitched shut.\nGo down now. Death is getting restless. Evil Saturday, foul Saturday...

6192355001750933 Merchant
6192355001750938 Disgruntled Man
6192355001750939 Excuse me?
6192355001750940 If you do, it will be your loss first and foremost.
6192355001750941 You're playing with fire, big shot. If the shop ain't open in an hour, we'll tear it down.
6192355001750942 Who told you the threat is no more?
6192355001750943 I seem to have misplaced the key...
6192355001750944 The people are starving. The children are starving. What was distributed the day before yesterday, gone now. You closed everything due to the threat of the infection.\nThe threat is no more, so open the shop back. Or we will simply dismantle it. Our patience is running thin.
6192355001750945 It's the empty can that makes the most noise. Rumor-mongering is worse than infection, it only promotes panic.
6192355001750946 No need to badmouth him. It's not the Judge who is in charge of supplies, but rather his assistants. I'll talk to them.
6192355001750947 Eh... dunno. But I know that the Judge, Georgiy Kain himself lifted the quarantine. Unlocked the isolation ward, dismissed the orderlies. So let him open the shop! If he doesn't, we'll break it open. Three huge bags of millet in there, and flour, too. The people know everything.
6192355001750948 It's you who are playing with fire now, good lady.
6192355001750949 Ungrateful bastards. All of you.
6192355001750950 If you don't open it. we'll get to you, too. You got yourself special treatment, ain't you? Don't play with fire, big shot.
6192355001750951 As far as I know, the Kains eat nothing but millet soup these days. The rest was given out to an angry mob like yours.
6192355001750952 It's not the Judge's area of responsibility, it's the committee's... They're right outside the Crucible, atop the stairs. I'll talk to them, just don't do anything stupid.
6192355001750953 Go to the Judge then, big shot! He'll open the shop. And let him give out his stock, too. The Kains got milk, grain, fresh veggies, meat even! Got it all stocked! The people know everything!
6192355001750954 Disgruntled Woman
6192355001750955 ...Oh, so you judged?
6192355001750956 What have you done, Georgiy! I erected every possible defense so diligently! And it is all ruined now—everything I worked to achieve!
6192355001750957 So you agree that the plague is already upon us? How do you know?
6192355001750958 There's a carrier here. Where are they?
6192355001750959 I dropped by your place at dawn, Bachelor. Wanted to warn you of my plans. Your young assistant asked me not to disturb you. I judged that it was better to let you have some rest. The catastrophe has already struck, and you needed all the strength you could muster to face the trials of today.
6192355001750960 I'm listening.
6192355001750961 Themistocles, I know. He met a rather gruesome end, by the way. Died of plague.
6192355001750962 Quite so. For I am the Judge. And, as is commonly agreed upon, I boast a certain level of intelligence. It's plain to me that you are on the verge of shredding me into pieces. But still your wrath. As a great Athenian once said, "Strike, if you will, but hear."
6192355001750963 ...I can't believe my ears. You let him go? Why in the world...?
6192355001750964 Indeed. A frightened and odd-looking man begged me for shelter yesterday. I let him go.
6192355001750965 A different angle? Such as...?
6192355001750966 An epidemic brings death. Let epidemologists venerate new lifeforms. To me, it's a calamity, and I'm truly surprised that a ruler such as yourself doesn't share my opinion.
6192355001750967 You are a fanatic, Bachelor. A crusader. You whole life is a duel with death. I know, I've read your articles. Followed your progress in the Capital. For many years you've been trying to eliminate the very phenomenon of death. You continue this war of yours in this town, too. But I implore you to look at this problem from a different angle.
6192355001750968 An exam? Explain yourself. This is a rather unexpected interpretation of a catastrophe that took away half the population of your town.
6192355001750969 How about sharing your elaborate theory with the people lying in mass graves across the river? Oh wait. They won't be able to hear you.
6192355001750970 A plague is just a type of death to you. But to me, it's essentially an exam. And one must not run away from exams forever. Sooner or later, one must take them.
6192355001750971 And yet you act as though you detest it.
6192355001750972 And yet you lifted the quarantine, exposing your creation. Would you put your own child on train tracks, too? Just to check? Because it's not entirely impossible it wouldn't survive?
6192355001750973 I have built this town, Bachelor. It's very unusual, you have to admit. This imponderable tower is its crowning achievement. And it was I who envisioned it like this. Surely you do not allow the thought that I do not care for it? This is my life's work! There's nothing in the world more dear to me.
6192355001750974 So you think the epidemic is a punishment for the attempt? This is Old Testament logic.
6192355001750975 Are you playing God?
6192355001750976 Towns are like people. Some are common and plain—content with their plainness. Others try to prevail over their nature. Grow. Reach for the sky.
6192355001750977 Georgiy, have you gone crazy?
6192355001750978 Common sense.
6192355001750979 And yet your town has obviously failed it.
6192355001750980 Perhaps a town can pass it, yes. But what about single individuals? The mere mortals? Are those who do not strive for godhood unworthy of living?
6192355001750981 Don't jump to conclusions. This isn't a punishment; this is an exam. Can't you tell the difference? An exam can be passed—and then one can move forward.
6192355001750982 Don't you care for the casualties? According to my statistics, some 15,000 people have died. Your compatriots. Your followers.
6192355001750983 Let us not jump to conclusions.
6192355001750984 ...Understand it?
6192355001750985 ...Master it?
6192355001750986 ...Bargain with it?
6192355001750987 My heart aches for them. This is dreadfully cruel. But perhaps the thing we are trying to build can only be erected with the help of those who have passed it—the exam of death. Who has learned not to fight it, like you do; not to deny it, but rather...
6192355001750988 You are truly, utterly mad.
6192355001750989 You make a reasonable point. And it just gave me an idea... Nevermind though.
6192355001750990 No. Embed it into themselves. Use it. Humanity has learned to use the law of gravity, hasn't it? There is your proof, just look out of the window. There was a time when humans could not brave the sky. But that time has passed.
6192355001750991 All right. Speak.
6192355001750992 No, it was Pericles. You are a learned man, but history is not your strong suit. Which is why you should listen to me. Perhaps it will help you see something that you missed in your previous studies.
6192355001750993 Or a hangman...?
6192355001750994 No. An obstetrician.

6192355001751064 Marat Ranin
6192355001751115 Dora Feugel
6192355001751117 Is that so? Why?
6192355001751118 Same here. What are you doing here? Why have you all abandoned your duties?
6192355001751119 I can't believe my eyes.
6192355001751120 ...Signed by me, right? Because if it isn't, that means you're way out of line, executing random orders.
6192355001751121 Sounds like nonsense. In any case, you can burn this paper.
6192355001751122 According to our papers... One moment, please, I'll find the precise... Ah, here it is! "After a short burst of fever, having woken up from anxious dreams, Bachelor Daniil Dankovsky passed away in hiw own bed, yesterday after nine o'clock, as the only known victim of the sand plague."
6192355001751123 ...And drink to my memory. I'm touched. Moved almost to tears.
6192355001751124 What victory? Nothing's over yet!
6192355001751125 Look around, you morons! It's beginning already!
6192355001751126 Since no signs of the sand plague were located in the Stone Yard, the Orderly Committee have unanimously decided to disband the medical worker corps. The most committed orderlies went across the river to transport dead bodies. The least committed ones went home. As for us, we've stayed here to celebrate your victory...
6192355001751127 Now listen to me. The threat is still very much present. Moreover, I'm quite positive that there is a carrier in the Stone Yard. Get back to work.
6192355001751128 Keep talking in this vein and it's your demise that will be untimely. Not according to the papers, mind you. I'll shoot you with my own hand.
6192355001751129 What...? I don't believe you. The Judge wouldn't.
6192355001751130 Since your untimely demise, Bachelor, Judge Georgiy Kain has become our direct supervisor. He cancelled your quarantine measures. Ordered a ceasefire, so to speak.
6192355001751131 How about getting your peepers open, you cretin? Here I am, alive, right in front of you!
6192355001751132 ...Oh, you got it all in writing! Obviously that means that nothing humanly possible can be done here. How silly of me.
6192355001751133 I don't know... According to the Judge's orders, there's nothing more to be done here. And in the case of Bachelor Dankovsky's death the Judge is the only person whose orders I'm supposed to follow. Here, see? I got it all in writing. Legal stuff.
6192355001751134 Official my arse... I'm going to the Judge to set this straight. And you will be punished severely for this break of conduct.
6192355001751135 The Judge is unwell. He's raving. I'm telling you this as a doctor, I just paid him a visit. So get back to work at once! Do the rounds and send one of your people to me as an assistant.
6192355001751136 Fine. You've convinced me. Well, since I'm dead, it's within the scope of your responsibilities to attend my place personally to oversee the funeral. Someone will have to take care of the bodies when the worst happens...
6192355001751137 I don't know what you're talking about. I got it all in writing. Anyone can impersonate Bachelor Dankovsky. As for me, I'm just standing my watch. As an official representative.
6192355001751138 "Legal paperwork" my arse... where did it even come from?
6192355001751139 Nope. Legal paperwork.
6192355001751140 That I will. As for you, get back to doing the rounds. Immediately.
6192355001751141 You're welcome to pay him a visit and see for yourself.
6192355001751142 Orderly-in-Chief
6192355001751165 My good people, who exactly are you planning to bury? I'd like to examine them first.
6192355001751166 ...And I doubt that's because I'm a brilliant conversationalist. Let us not waste any time, lead the way.
6192355001751167 Is the dancing in my honor, too? I can see that someone's dancing over there, behind your back.
6192355001751168 You are the doctor. We've been expecting you.
6192355001751169 And I can appreciate your husband's choice. Any sane person would prefer the noose to dealing with your steppe traditions.
6192355001751170 "Until the evening"? And then let him die, right?
6192355001751171 Clearly you're quite fond of your dear husband.
6192355001751172 No. First you will listen. My husband doesn't want you to treat him. He refuses to live.\nWe need him to live until the evening. You will help.
6192355001751173 All right, let's get to it. Where is he?
6192355001751174 I see. Clearly the stories of the steppe people not being susceptible to the sand plague turned out to be false.
6192355001751175 Yes.
6192355001751176 Enough. Where is he?
6192355001751177 He sounds like a good man. But I have a strong suspicion his affliction is incurable.
6192355001751178 I do not understand my husband. He loves his sister too much. More than his people.
6192355001751179 It's nice to have everything decided for you.
6192355001751180 I'm not omnipotent. Don't pin all your hopes on me.
6192355001751181 Go to the yurt. You are the doctor. You will help.
6192355001751182 Herb Bride
6192355001751183 [Try and operate without the items required, using makeshift bandages and hoping for the best. One of the steppe people offers you a crooked needle and something like a tourniquet, but they're barely sufficient.]
6192355001751184 [You have everything you need. Proceed with the operation.]
6192355001751185 [Leave.]
6192355001751186 [The creature is breathing heavily. A deep and dirty wound is gaping across its belly. No one's bothered to dress it. To operate on him, one would require clean bandages and painkillers. And you'll have to move fast.]
6192355001751187 Damn it to hell... I knew, didn't I...?
6192355001751188 I'm sorry...
6192355001751189 [..................\nThere is an internal bleeding. The creature dies.]
6192355001751190 [Continue.]
6192355001751191 .........
6192355001751192 Who did this to you? The wound looks suspiciously self-inflicted.
6192355001751193 Mistake. This is most certainly me. Now please shut up and let me do my work.
6192355001751194 ...Not you.
6192355001751195 I'm not cutting you open, I'm stitching you closed. So please calm down, we can do without your moronic superstitions.
6192355001751196 "Go away"? Are you for real? Fine. I'm leaving. Do whatever you want.
6192355001751197 The one who did this for you definitely knew though. An impressive wound. Was it one of your lot?
6192355001751198 Not know the lines. Not know how to cut open. Go away.\nOutsider.
6192355001751199 ...You know what? You're right. I don't have to deal with all this.\nTo hell with you.
6192355001751200 Like hell I will. You dragged me here, so I'll see it through to the end.
6192355001751201 Family business. Leave.
6192355001751202 ...Here you go. All right, all done. Perhaps you'll live now, big guy.
6192355001751203 Wedding? Not yours, obviously, so why should you worry?
6192355001751204 Leave. Let die.\nIf I die, then no wedding.\nFew of us left.
6192355001751205 All done. No drinking until the evening. No touching stitches. No gratitude expected, either.
6192355001751206 All done. You are lucky to have such a caring wife, Worm.
6192355001751207 No. Not mine...
6192355001751208 ...Right. I've spoiled everything. Of course.
6192355001751209 I'm touched. A patient's gratitude is the most rewarding thing a doctor can hear.
6192355001751210 Enemy. Spoiled everything.

6192355001751220 I'm not here to have fun.
6192355001751221 A local custom, huh?
6192355001751222 All right. I'm turning my back and closing my eyes.
6192355001751223 No place for you here.\nA wedding. Not for you to watch.
6192355001751224 Shar Shuvuu
6192355001751225 I'm quite content with my given name, thank you.

6192355001751318 Committee Clerk
6192355001751319 What? If what you're saying is true, why the bloody hell is the Judge doing what he is doing? Why is he cancelling my orders?
6192355001751320 Perhaps he's not as mad as you think.
6192355001751321 Finally! It feels nice to find someone both influential and like-minded. Was this the reason for his late-night visit?
6192355001751322 The Judge has lost his mind, Bachelor. He denies the obvious. Claims that the epidemic is still here...
6192355001751323 Quite so. I would very much enjoy offering the Judge a good bloodletting now!
6192355001751324 Just let me in.
6192355001751325 I know very little. The Judge's is a brilliant mind. Master used to be extremely shrewd and conscientious. Help him, doctor. Perhaps pills or leeches are in order? A bloodletting, maybe...?
6192355001751326 ...What? What did you say? I want to hear it once again! Has your master truly gone mad?
6192355001751327 Ha ha. You have an odd sense of humor.
6192355001751328 He went to warn you that he's relieving the quarantine, cancelling your orders. He disbanded the soldiers. Unlocked the Cathedral. Sent the orderlies away to the other side of the river. Master is a very kind man.
6192355001751329 Doorkeeper
6192355001751858 "Wicks"?
6192355001751859 No.
6192355001751860 Those are not "my" beakheads. They're on their own. Orderlies. I'll ask them.
6192355001751861 Good day, sir. They say your beakheads raided a den in the Atrium last night, found a huge bunch of them wicks. Did they...?
6192355001751862 I don't know. Never heard a thing about a raid.
6192355001751863 Who knows, perhaps they did.
6192355001751864 Them infected gits. Got themselves a pretty lil' nickname, they did. The ones that are burning 'n hiding away from the quarantine are "wicks". Those who cover themselves in rags, the responsible ones, are "mites", as in "dynamite". So, did the beakheads really snatch themselves a bunch of wicks?
6192355001751865 Indeed? But why?
6192355001751866 Who gave the order? I was told yesterday that General Block passed away.
6192355001751867 And look at us here, guarding the drugstore, our bunch. The order's that not a thing is to be taken away from the store. Terrible danger.
6192355001751868 Bacteria samples?! What in the world are you talking about? How moronic does one have to be to bring them here?
6192355001751869 All right, I'll check.
6192355001751870 Um... They brought your samples here, I believe? The plague vials?
6192355001751871 I see... what a pointless loss.
6192355001751872 Why?
6192355001751873 'Ndeed he has... the man's been bulletproof for so many years, but the plague finally got to him, bless his soul. Captain Longin is in charge now. He gave the order too.
6192355001751874 Don't worry, I have your head covered.
6192355001751875 I need medicine, not the plague test-tubes.
6192355001751876 I'm just doing my duty, sir. If this is an inspection, I can let you in. Will have to search you after though, sorry 'bout that in advance. Safety measures 'n all. Nothing is to be taken from the store. Not a single item.\nI mean, personally I respect you, but the orders were clear. No one wants to have their head court-martialled.
6192355001751877 Can we strike a bargain, perhaps...?
6192355001751878 Go ahead, do your thing. I've always dreamt of being searched like a common thug...
6192355001751879 Sorry, doctor, but I'm going to have to search you. Nothing's to be carried out of the store. I warned you, so no hard feelings, eh?
6192355001751880 I can see that General Ashes has nurtured an unwavering spirit in you lot.
6192355001751881 It's not like I'll be the one to regret this.
6192355001751882 No. Hands up, please.
6192355001751883 Guard
6192355001751884 Sort of.
6192355001751885 And who are you, lad?
6192355001751886 "Old man"? Really? As a person way above your rank, I am to be addressed as "Your Excellency".
6192355001751887 Old man...? Psst, hey? Sir? Lend me an ear, will ya...? You're, like, the head guy here, right?
6192355001751897 What for? If you're sick, you're not taking powders, you're coming with me.
6192355001751898 Well, what does it have to do with me?
6192355001751899 Look, old man... You're, like... Ugh. Listen, that drugstore, they have medicine there, like powders. I mean, it's not like everything got stolen, right? Something has to remain. \nBut that twat of a soldier is a vigilant jerk. And I need powders!
6192355001751900 Your Auntie, huh?
6192355001751901 I'm sending 'em 'cross the river, to my Auntie.
6192355001751902 You'll wait for me? Yeah, right. I require a more inventive scam to be fooled.
6192355001751903 You drop these silly ideas right now. And shoo! The last thing I want is to see you get yourself killed...
6192355001751904 I'll get the items I need without your help just fine.
6192355001751905 You tell the soldier, he'll let you in. 'Tis not in his interest to get on your bad side. 'N then you can, like, throw all that you find to me from the window. There's a broken window upstairs. We'll split the profit! I'll wait for you down there.
6192355001751906 And what might you want, Cookaroo, Khan Kain's best friend?
6192355001751907 Ugh, you urchins! I'm fed up with you. Roaming around like you've got nothing better to do, breaking the quarantine, spreading infection. Being the first ones to die, I might add, and dragging your families along, too! What, am I wrong?
6192355001751908 I'm Cookaroo, I'm local. Khan Kain's best friend. You ask around, everyone knows me.
6192355001751909 I don't smoke. Go home and leave me alone.
6192355001751910 Still not convinced.
6192355001751911 We'll discuss your smoking habits if I find you waiting for me when I return. Let's try this great heist of yours.
6192355001751912 I mean it. Word! There's no other way to get anything from that drugstore. We can help each other. C'mon, old man...!\nEveryone knows me here, you just ask around, Cookaroo's a man of his word, they'll tell you! \nI'll wait by the window, I promise. Got a cig?
6192355001751913 ...Not convinced. You run along now.
6192355001751914 A smart lad, are you? All right, deal.
6192355001751915 'Tis not in my interest to get on your bad side either.
6192355001751927 I think you're lying, punk.
6192355001751928 Helping you is the only way, huh? All right, I'll buy it.
6192355001751929 Nuh huh! You won't. This store's the only place that's got anything useful, but you'd be arsed to smuggle the lousiest bottle out past that jerk of a soldier. 'Tis either with my help or not at all. So...?
6192355001751930 Cookaroo
6192355001751931 ...Seems like I have to admit to the truthfulness of prophetic dreams now. Where and when did you get infected?
6192355001751932 Not to you. To me, there is. And to all the people outside.
6192355001751933 I worked so bloody hard to save the last patch of infection-free land in this damn town! Do you even realize what you've done...? Why did you have to hide?
6192355001751934 ...And then there were three. Stay with us, doctor. There's nothing to be afraid of, you'll see.
6192355001751935 You're lying. This is the sand pest. It's incurable.
6192355001751936 What do you mean, "well"? You're doomed.
6192355001751937 We don't know... Is it important? It's almost over. We're almost well.
6192355001751938 You're lying. This is the sand pest. It's incurable.
6192355001751939 Of course you're not going anywhere! You're leaving this house feet first.
6192355001751940 We're not going anywhere. We don't need to. It's almost over. We're almost well.
6192355001751941 Exactly. These are fatal symptoms.
6192355001751942 ...I'd kill you with my own hands if I could.
6192355001751943 Everything's gone now. There's no fever. No pain. No fear. Only elation.\nLook at my sister. Look how much better she feels now. She can almost keep her head up. Can almost stand.
6192355001751944 Lotman
6192355001751961 What's this?
6192355001751962 ...Who gave the order?
6192355001751963 .....
6192355001751964 What were you burning?
6192355001751965 ...
6192355001751966 I believe it's wood.\nNot like anyone can tell now...
6192355001751967 Who does? Who says that?
6192355001751968 No. I didn't give such an order.
6192355001751969 You did, they say. This is being done in your name.
6192355001751970 Did they show you a paper? Signed by me? Damn it...
6192355001751971 The orderlies? The masked ones? Huh...
6192355001751972 Your lot came here. The orderlies, I mean, the "Talon" guys. \nThey do.
6192355001751973 My orders...?
6192355001751974 I ordered you to burn signal fires at suspicious locations! What happened here?
6192355001751975 I mean... It's best not to look, I guess.\nWood. Logs. Per your orders.
6192355001751976 Oh, I'll get to the bottom of this!
6192355001751977 This is it. No more fires from this point on.
6192355001751978 Yes, fires. Per your orders.\nYou ordered for the fires to burn, didn't you? Here you go...
6192355001751979 Watchman
6192355001752017 Committee Clerk
6192355001752047 Committee Clerk
6192355001752141 What thing?
6192355001752142 I know... The infection found its way here! And its carrier must be around, perhaps walking the streets right now...
6192355001752143 Doctor, wake up. A bad thing happened.
6192355001752144 The dream comes true... Who is this Blacky person?
6192355001752145 We'll see about that... Where is he?
6192355001752146 Whether it's the sand thing or not is for me to decide. But well done, lad, waking me up immediately. An hour of hesitation could have cost us the town's life.
6192355001752147 Blacky's old man is ill. But it's not plague. I mean, not the sand thing.\n...Will you cure him? And not send beakheads after him?
6192355001752148 And why would that be?
6192355001752149 Oh no, you're not walking me anywhere. You're staying put, right here. You were in contact with an infected person! I'll examine you later.
6192355001752150 Right there in the Neck yard. The first house, over there, you can see it from the doorway.\nI'd walk you there but I can't. We shouldn't be seen together.
6192355001752151 I see... Yes, the orderlies' reputation is rather bleak.
6192355001752152 You do understand, don't you, that the fate of the whole town—or what's left of it—depends on how quickly patient zero is isolated? \n...Thanks for at least telling me about the patient.
6192355001752153 Because. You'll bring the beakheads to the Blackers and they'll say it was me who ratted them out. No one'll talk to me after that.
6192355001752154 Mind your manners, young man!
6192355001752155 I'm not going to repeat myself. You're staying in. And don't talk back to me!
6192355001752156 It's not the sand thing with him, I'm telling you! Geez!
6192355001752157 Really? Sounds odd. All right. I'll deal with your Blacky first and than pay a visit to the Crucible.
6192355001752158 What do you mean, "stopped him"? What if it was important? Are you out of your mind, lad? Do you appreciate what's at stake here?
6192355001752159 Also, the Judge was here. Demanded you be woken up. I stopped him.\nDidn't like how the old geezer looked at all. Nuts, is how he looked, hands shaking and all.
6192355001752160 There's a carrier of the plague in the town! I mean... perhaps. That's what my intuition tells me. Anyway, now is not the time to be flippant at all!
6192355001752161 All right. An hour is not much. I'll look into it.
6192355001752162 He looked completely nuts, I'm telling you. And you looked dead tired.\nThe Judge was here an hour ago or so anyway, must be at his place now. It's next door.
6192355001752184 Sticky
6192355001752185 Sticky
6192355001752186 Beakheads? Is this the monicker you've given the orderlies? Don't be afraid of them, they are public servants. Doing a good job, too.
6192355001752187 Is that your father?
6192355001752188 It's not the sand pest. Don't tell 'em beakheads!\nHe'll get better. I know it.
6192355001752189 Where's your mother?
6192355001752190 When did he get sick?
6192355001752191 Stepfather. Same thing.\nHe brought me up. Provided for me.
6192355001752192 Pah! Stop bossing me around...
6192355001752193 Here's to hoping...
6192355001752194 Hell if I know... Now c'mon, go ahead 'n make him better!
6192355001752195 All right, shush. Let's take a look at your old man.
6192355001752196 When did he get sick?
6192355001752197 Nothin' good 'bout their job. A fast job, is what they do. You just sneeze—'n here they are, grabbin' you with them hooks, draggin' to the ward.\n'N 'tis where the sick are. So the only way out of there is feet first.
6192355001752198 Sounds bad.
6192355001752199 Merely an hour? This is good news.
6192355001752200 An hour ago or so. Dropped down 'n started beating 'n flopping like a fish, mouth open 'n all.\nI brought him water, but he couldn't tell it was me...

6192355001752389 Are you out of your mind?
6192355001752390 What paper? Where am I supposed to get such a paper?
6192355001752391 Sign a paper, sir, please. For me. I'll show it to my mum. I'll show her that I didn't shoot.
6192355001752392 How many were killed?
6192355001752393 After your shift is over, go to the Crucible. They'll sign it for you there.
6192355001752394 No, sir. I'll show my mum so that she knows I didn't kill anyone. Please sign a paper.
6192355001752395 Why would you need such a paper? To frame it on the wall?
6192355001752396 All right, all right...
6192355001752397 I was recruited yesterday, I'm a local! You can just leave, and I'll have to live with the aftermath!\nIt were the real soldiers who did the shooting...
6192355001752398 Damn...
6192355001752399 I don't do signing.
6192355001752400 ...A lot.
6192355001752401 Sentry
6192355001752402 What children?
6192355001752403 Good. You'll be relieved of your duty soon.
6192355001752404 The children are asleep. All is quiet.
6192355001752405 Who is in charge of their well-being? Are they fed? Provided water?
6192355001752406 What tower?
6192355001752407 Oh... A towerful of children. Right-o. How could I forget.
6192355001752408 Eh? The children in the tower. Over there.\nSeveral hundred. No entry.
6192355001752409 At ease.
6192355001752410 I see.
6192355001752411 No one reports that to us.
6192355001752412 Cura te ipsum. Heard the phrase? It's about me.
6192355001752413 I'm fine. It's you who's overworked.
6192355001752414 ...Doctor, are you... I mean... umm...\nWhat about you? Who takes care of you if you feel unwell or have a headache?
6192355001752415 Polyhedron Sentry
6192355001752435 Orderly No. 12
6192355001752436 How rude. Ungratefulness is the worst sin.
6192355001752437 Wrong. As long as I'm the only doctor in this town, everything's my business.
6192355001752438 Whatcha looking at? Move along. Our business here, not yers.
6192355001752439 Watch your tongue! Perhaps you need jailtime to cool your head off?
6192355001752440 It hasn't been easy on you, I know. Please stay patient some more.
6192355001752441 Ye ordered to lock the shop yesterday, didntcha? Well, lo and behold. 'Tis locked.\nSo why did ye come? An exception, are ye? Locked for everyone but ye? Ye big-city fucker...
6192355001752442 Disgruntled Man
6192355001752443 So you came for the cure. Are you sick?
6192355001752444 What's inside?
6192355001752445 I came here before you. But you may go in first. I need to pluck up my courage.
6192355001752446 So this Aspity is a dream-teller, huh?
6192355001752447 "Aspity"? Who's that?
6192355001752448 No, I'm not sick. I came here so that Aspity would explain my dream to me. We all did.
6192355001752449 So what did you dream of?
6192355001752450 "Dream truths"? "Dream lies"? What are you talking about?
6192355001752451 What a curious coincidence. I also happened to dream of a rather frightening thing today.\nThanks for letting me cut the queue. I will indeed have a chat with this individual.
6192355001752452 Indeed. I dreamed of a frightening thing today. Only Aspity can tell dream truths from dream lies.
6192355001752453 If you tell me what you dreamed of, you can have any item of mine. I'll even let you choose which one.
6192355001752454 A truly outstanding gift... And, well, you have every right not to tell me.
6192355001752455 That is my business, not yours. Even if I told you, it would be pointless. You would only hear dream lies.\nAspity, on the other hand, can see your dream with her own eyes. So it doesn't matter which words you use to describe it.
6192355001752456 Ah! I see... Of the sand plague, I believe?
6192355001752457 Same here.
6192355001752458 I dreamed that I would die today. And that I wouldn't be the only one.
6192355001752459 Sounds reassuring.
6192355001752460 Well, thank you. Take your time plucking up all the courage you need.
6192355001752461 You look healthy. That's a relief. But I think you'd better find a more suitable place for your future conversations with this dream-teller of yours.
6192355001752462 No. Aspity taught us how not to fear that bogeyman. There is no sand plague.\nI saw death by fire.
6192355001752463 And you're expecting this... family reunion to go less than smoothly, I gather?
6192355001752464 Tonight, Aspity came here. Sahba-ötün, our mother and the mistress of dreams.
6192355001752465 What about you? What did you dream of?
6192355001752466 Ugh, the steppe superstitions strike again...
6192355001752467 All dreams are prophetic. But ordinary people can't tell which dream-things will happen inevitably, which can be changed, and which were merely dross.
6192355001752468 So she can see beyond the present and mundane, huh...?
6192355001752469 Sahba-ötün. A wise woman. She knows how to see. Knows how to listen.
6192355001752470 Believer
6192355001752471 Damn...
6192355001752472 I don't care. I was just passing by.
6192355001752473 Nothing to see here, doctor. It's all over.\nA shame you weren't here earlier... but there's nothing to be done now.
6192355001752474 Soldier
6192355001752499 How do you know?
6192355001752500 Here comes Bachelor Dankovsky, the man who failed to defeat death.
6192355001752501 Really? Well, what did I do yesterday?
6192355001752502 And what am I going to do tomorrow?
6192355001752503 If you're so smart, kindly tell me what I am doing now.
6192355001752504 We know all about you. We know what you did yesterday and what you are going to do tomorrow.
6192355001752505 Go on, go on.
6192355001752506 You don't seem to hold my achievements in high regard.
6192355001752507 Yesterday? Stuffed our houses chock-full of refugees from across the river, forbidding them to go outside.\nRobbed our wardrobe department and dressed your medical staff as mourners. Judged the Judge...
6192355001752508 Huh... You got everything right. Who could have guessed.
6192355001752509 Anyone can make predictions like these. All my actions are public.
6192355001752510 ...Turned the Cathedral into an isolation ward. The Crucible, into the headquarters. The Polyhedron, an ark.\nAssigned sentries and hit the cot at dawn.
6192355001752511 Why is that...?
6192355001752512 Everything will be decided this evening, Excellency. A terrible appointment is in store for you, and you will not emerge from it victorious. \nIndeed, we do know the key to victory, but alas! It will be of no use to Bachelor Dankovsky.
6192355001752513 The doleful humor is what I love your troupe for. I've heard this one a ton of times, and yet it never gets old.
6192355001752514 How?
6192355001752515 ...There won't be a tomorrow. Today is your last day, Excellency. Please make good use of it.
6192355001752516 You are anything but a fool.
6192355001752517 Mine were numbered by me, written down neatly, and are now kept in perfect order.
6192355001752518 Now? Making a fool of yourself by talking to a fool about his foolish endeavors and engaging in various tomfoolery, wasting priceless droplets of time.\nWe have very little of the latter left, by the way. Have our days been numbered by ourselves...? Or were it hours...
6192355001752519 So if I had a softer heart, you'd teach me how to win this duel?
6192355001752520 Only a man with an open heart can overcome such an adversary.
6192355001752521 An outbreak doesn't seem like a good time to become soft-hearted. But I'll keep your words in mind.
6192355001752522 I'm wasting my time here...
6192355001752523 Maybe. Possibly. But it's useless to explain to a heartless man. ...Take heart, Excellency! If you ever find it, that is. And then come back to us... Even though it all sounds like a rather implausible turn of events.
6192355001752524 Here... I've taken heart. Taken a heart, I mean. Undoubtedly, an open one.
6192355001752525 Excellency...? It's so heartwarming to see you in good health.
6192355001752526 You wanted me to come back to you with an open heart. Well, here I am.
6192355001752527 ...It looked too fitting to be a coincidence.
6192355001752528 Oh... Excellency. What a sordid sight! Sorry for underestimating you. You definitely do have... how shall I put it... a creative touch. But this is pure madness. You can't take things so literally!
6192355001752529 This cage is called "life." I'm in no hurry to break out of it.
6192355001752530 You promised to help me out with this evening's appointment.
6192355001752531 Come now, Excellency... come now! Do you think this is some sort of game? Even if it is, it most certainly is not played by your rules! A game is a cage, and if you fail to break out of it, you lose! We know what we're talking about.
6192355001752532 Thank you. I'll think it over.
6192355001752533 You buffoons...
6192355001752534 Never agree to play a game if you don't understand its rules. The stakes are too high. If you already have, challenge and change those rules, Bachelor Dankovsky. Challenge and change.
6192355001752535 What do you need then?
6192355001752536 I wasn't planning to donate anything.
6192355001752537 Save your spare change. We don't need money.
6192355001752538 What if I were to switch troupes completely and join yours full-time? How about that?
6192355001752539 The play I'm performing in is starting to wear old.
6192355001752540 Would you really like to help? We're lacking a number of crucial performers. ...But, alas, you are already starring in a different play, Excellency. Although, in all honesty, you're far from brilliant.
6192355001752541 In that case, would you mind telling me what these... tools of torture are for? The ones you're standing by?
6192355001752542 I very much doubt you have anything I might need. Seems like the opposite is correct—it is I who's fulfilling your incredibly odd wishes.
6192355001752543 We can't hire you. Not until tomorrow, anyway.\nAside from that, we're at your service, Excellency.
6192355001752544 Is that so? Why?
6192355001752545 These? Oh, these are merely reminders. Anchors. To avoid laxity. We are actors, so we play... yet any play, performance, or game is a cage.
6192355001752546 What do you mean?
6192355001752547 Bravo! Bravo, Excellency. Double score. Seems like you're beginning to understand. Now pause for a second and do your best not to forget this brilliant answer.\nIt'll save your life one day. Never play by someone else's rules, Excellency. Invent your own.
6192355001752548 Perhaps I will.
6192355001752549 You've given me a curious idea, mime...
6192355001752550 Any play, performance, or game is a cage because it's played by the rules written by someone else. How can a heartless man escape such a cage? That is the question. And we are yet to find the answer. Who knows—perhaps you'll be of help in this matter.
6192355001752551 Please be so kind as to explain clearer.
6192355001752552 You mean that thing you said about games and cages?
6192355001752553 We just did. A very fitting coincidence indeed.

6192355001752609 It's not like I have any.
6192355001752610 Planning to take the goods with you to kingdom come...?
6192355001752611 No money. Barter only.
6192355001752612 Merchant
6192355001752613 Were there victims on your watch?
6192355001752614 Me. Carry on here.
6192355001752615 We've been told today that there are no commanders left. When General Block was killed, Longin took the lead.\n...Now they say that Longin is also dying. All the officers are across the river. So who issues orders?
6192355001752616 How many were killed?
6192355001752617 Yeah... Whal else is there to say indeed.
6192355001752618 Er... Well, the perimeter was breached a couple of times. Not as badly as the day before yesterday, but still, formidable attempts. There was shooting... what else is there to say?
6192355001752619 What inspection? Where are the inspectors?
6192355001752620 An inspection? From the Crucible, you mean? All right, I'll check on them.
6192355001752621 How should I know who's dead and who's wounded! Stop twisting the knife, doctor.\nThere was an inspection, they wrote it all down. Go bother them.
6192355001752622 I ordered no such thing...
6192355001752623 It's not my Cathedral. I'm not a local...
6192355001752624 How should I know? Across the river, perhaps, or in that Cathedral of yours where you gather suspicious people.\n...We, on the other hand, gather no one. We were ordered to shoot on sight.
6192355001752625 ...
6192355001752626 Keep your watch.
6192355001752627 Who did then? Everything that happens, doctor, is attributed to you. Everything...
6192355001752628 Sentry
6192355001752629 What kind of a machine?
6192355001752630 Who in the world are you?
6192355001752631 Each time I catch a glimpse of that giant clock up there, I am reminded of the fact that the Cathedral is not a temple, but rather a machine.
6192355001752632 Really? What makes you think so?
6192355001752633 Previously, this place served as an isolation ward for the infected, the suspected, and the ones who may have contracted the disease. I assume you're one of them?
6192355001752634 A time machine? Are you saying it can transport me to the past or to the future? Like in that Englishman's book, what's his name...
6192355001752635 This is a time machine. Time works differently on the inside and on the outside. It's frozen now. I think something's broken.
6192355001752636 So you're a local religious worker?
6192355001752637 Care to give me more details?
6192355001752638 The people who had been brought here on your orders spent several days in this stone prison. Yet to them, it looks as though everything happened today. Time is holding its breath here, the day lingers. I've spent quite enough time in this Cathedral, sir, so I know how to spot such things.
6192355001752639 This doesn't make sense. If they're sick, locking themselves in won't help.
6192355001752640 This Cathedral sounds more like a cold room than a machine. A gateway protecting one from non-existence?
6192355001752641 I am but a humble servant. I work here; I always have and always will be confined to this place, so don't worry about me. I won't go anywhere.\nThose two also refuse to leave... which means they cling to life too much. Understandable obstinacy.
6192355001752642 How do you know?
6192355001752643 It's not like that. The Kains have designed it to produce time. To alter it, stretch and compress it. But like all the Kains' attempts at challenging nature, it is unfinished, imperfect, and faltering.
6192355001752644 You are either a fatalist or a fanatic. Cathedrals can't save people from plagues.
6192355001752645 Whether they can leave or not is for me to decide, and I'd prefer to get to that.
6192355001752646 You're quite right. If they leave this place like those poor careless souls from before, they'll simply die. There's no doubt about it.
6192355001752647 Drawing the perfect picture of my life in this bloody town of yours.
6192355001752648 All right, less small talk and more examining the seekers of the life eternal. What are they called anyway, Adam and Eve?
6192355001752649 Look up, Bachelor. Can you see the clock? Its hands are frozen. Outside, they won't live to see the evening—but in here, nothing will threaten their lives until time starts running again... If you can call this pathetic feverish crawling inside a heartless stone belly "life", that is.
6192355001752650 That'll do too.
6192355001752651 Stand your watch.
6192355001752652 Marat and Dora.
6192355001752653 Perhaps this place gives them more food for thought than the outside.
6192355001752654 I didn't come here to indulge in philosophizing, you buffoon. I just did what had to be done.
6192355001752655 I'm not wise, just diligent.
6192355001752656 Blessed is the dead who thinks he is alive. Why hurt their idyll? That would be too cruel. ...You are a wise man, Bachelor. If they want to live through this evil day again and again... who are we to rob them of their bliss—confusing non-existence for existence?
6192355001752657 Same here. Curious indeed.
6192355001752658 I'm a doctor. I know full well that they don't have much time left. The lad's case in particular doesn't look... and, honestly, the girl's isn't much better.
6192355001752659 I took pity on them. Had a hunch that they'd simply perish here. As for out there, who knows...
6192355001752660 You did the right thing, doctor. They left this place completely assured that they are going to die. To overcome the fear of death is a great achievement. Who knows? Perhaps this particular act of bravery is exactly what saved their lives. I'd be curious to follow their fates. Thank you.
6192355001752661 Clockworker
6192355001752667 Pay respects? To whom?
6192355001752668 What's going on? Who are these people?
6192355001752669 Did you come to pay respects?
6192355001752670 No. I'm not.
6192355001752671 Let me in. I want to have some sleep.
6192355001752672 You aren't a local, are you?
6192355001752673 The local crowd needs to check their facts better. I am Daniil Dankovsky.
6192355001752674 Your clock is running fast. Let me in.
6192355001752675 Daniil Dankovsky, a doctor from the capital, passed away in this house an hour ago. Would you like to come in to pay respects?\nPlease. Rituals are very important for the local crowd.
6192355001752676 Mourner
6192355001752866 What treatment? Who are we going to treat? Where's everyone?
6192355001752867 What's done?
6192355001752868 I thought you were dead.
6192355001752869 Everything's done. I got a bit sleepy though... Sorry about that.\nShall we proceed with the treatment, doctor?
6192355001752870 You're raving... and not making too much sense.
6192355001752871 You need to have some rest. If you're not squeamish, you can take any bed.
6192355001752872 Oh the condescension... Perhaps you can also enlighten me as to where the source of the outbreak was?
6192355001752873 Don't give me that look, doctor... and don't blame yourself. I think I know why we ended up like this.\nYour attention must have slipped today. You didn't put all the pieces together. Failed to assemble the puzzle...
6192355001752874 I don't believe they got better.
6192355001752875 Of course they must have. They are all probably home already.
6192355001752876 I gave the patients water and wet towels to relieve the fever. But I can't find a single one of them now... They must have gotten better and left.
6192355001752877 "Puzzle" is not the word I would use. I'm glad you're feeling better, Dora. Now get some rest.
6192355001752878 A shame I can't live through it all again. I'd manage to uncover the pattern connecting all the facts... but oh well.
6192355001752879 You told us yourself, don't you remember? Everything that transpired, did so for a very good reason. The puzzle was almost solved, but some pieces must have slipped. Me, I don't even know what events you were referring to. It was your day, after all, not mine... Evil Saturday. Foul Saturday.
6192355001752880 I'm sorry to hear that.
6192355001752881 This is silly. I just zoned out for a moment.
6192355001752882 So did I! About you, I mean. Marat and I came to ask you what to do next, and there you were, lying in a coffin.\nMarat snapped. He doesn't trust you anymore.
6192355001752883 Dora Feugel
6192355001752884 I did my best.
6192355001752885 Stop it with the shouting.
6192355001752886 What makes you think I've resigned to die?
6192355001752887 Ah... so it's true? You're given up? Resigned to die? Thrown in the towel?\nThe great Bachelor Dankovsky... a celebrity thanatologist. The scientist who is claimed to have defeated death itself. Utterly failed, haven't you?
6192355001752888 No. It is not.
6192355001752889 This isn't a common epidemic, mate. Isn't yersinia pestis. Neither is it the Black Death. This is something completely new. You want to me overcome it in a week? How about decades!
6192355001752890 You did nothing! The whole town hung on your every word, you were treated like a prophet. A leader. The leader! The Judge, Fat Vlad, Saburov—they all trusted you. All the while you were feeding the town to the plague, district by district... Our town has become nothing more than an arena for your duel with death. Isn't that right?
6192355001752891 Stop it with the foam at the mouth! Or do I need to teach you good composure?
6192355001752892 The easy way is shifting all the responsibility from your dumb heads to my shoulders!
6192355001752893 I trusted you! We all did. For as long as you lived, so did we. I know it first hand. And now you've decided you've had enough and marched into the grave meekly, like a lamb to the slaughter! It must feel nice to find an easy way out!
6192355001752894 Get a grip. You're a quitter and a disgrace.
6192355001752895 Post hoc non propter hoc, as they used to say...
6192355001752896 It all just slipped through your fingers! The disease infiltrated the Stone Yard today, but you didn't notice! Your type would never go through a back alley, your routes are always the same, from the main street to the main square and back. Perhaps you weren't really looking? Perhaps you're in league with it? The epidemic began the day you arrived in the town. I wonder if that's a coincidence...
6192355001752897 Marat Ranin
6192355001752898 Took them where?
6192355001752899 Took whom away?
6192355001752900 Done... I took them all away. Can't do no more.
6192355001752901 I can't make heads or tails of your babbling!
6192355001752902 This is not my house, this is a temporary place of residence. And it was I who ordered to set up hospital here. Nothing to apologize for.
6192355001752903 They're on the other side of that door. I couldn't carry them any further, I'm exhausted.\nSorry for making such a mess of your house... But I ain't going back there. Don't make me.
6192355001752904 What about you? How are you feeling?
6192355001752905 Everyone.
6192355001752906 We're not done yet. Stay alert, I may need you.
6192355001752907 Take a break, number twelve. You are released from duty.
6192355001752908 I'm dead tired, doctor. I haven't had a decent sleep for two days now... Any more assignments?\nWe're goners anyway, no chance to break out of here. We did all we could, but this seems to be it. Orderly number twelve, going off duty... 
6192355001752909 This epidemic destroyed eight thousand people in a week. Do you really have to ask?
6192355001752910 There were thirteen districts in your town. Miraculously, I managed to save two. Dozens of refugees are sheltered here. There will be survivors.
6192355001752911 Did you take the sick to the side room, you nitwit? It has no proper conditions, it's too small!
6192355001752912 Just one more thing, doc... Reckon there is still hope?
6192355001752913 The Lil' One
6192355001752914 Orderly No. 12
6192355001752915 Herb Bride
6192355001753435 Well?
6192355001753436 This is not a good time for reports. I'm in a hurry.
6192355001753437 Grigory Gorky, number six. Here to report to you, doctor.
6192355001753438 You're leaving nowhere. It's quite the opposite, actually: you're staying here to comb every suspicious nook and cranny. We've missed something. I know it.
6192355001753439 The state of the coast is mine to evaluate. And my information differs from yours. How many of you are here in the Stone Yard? Thirty six? I need every commanding orderly to report to me, stat. You have half an hour.
6192355001753440 Generally the coast is clear, sir. No signs of the plague.\nI'd say you've won. Congratulations are in order. As for us, we are leaving this part of the town. Our place is across the river. Still work to be done there.
6192355001753441 ...So the orderlies have deserted. And yet you have the gall to claim that everything is all right.
6192355001753442 ...There's no rest for the wicked. I never dismissed the orderlies—so why are they gone? Do my words mean nothing?
6192355001753443 ...But most orderlies are gone for good. Some of them, gone home even. Come now, doctor. Your work is done.\nTake a look at yourself! I've seen happier corpses. You're overworked and deserve a rest. A good, long, peaceful rest...
6192355001753444 Let them stay there. Report to me when I find them. Then I'll check the suspicious spots myself.\nThe rest of you deserve to be court-martialled—you keep that in mind, number six!
6192355001753445 ...Thank god someone's heart and mind are in the right place.
6192355001753446 There's simply nothing left to do. The coast is clear. There are several orderlies who have not abandoned their duties... they're probably still out there, guarding suspicious spots. They insist on staying unless you withdraw the orders personally, doctor. Bootlickers, if you ask me. Subservient show-offs.
6192355001753447 Yes.
6192355001753448 No, it was... another thing. No matter. No off you go—and start with the search! If you see anything suspicious, report to me immediately! Every hour counts now.
6192355001753449 None of your business. 
6192355001753450 Why so tense, doctor? If I may ask?\nSome whippersnapper just rushed past me. Was it he that disturbed you?
6192355001753451 Don't you try to be clever with me, number six. Return to your duty.
6192355001753452 The little rascals are not to blame; irresponsible idiots like you are.
6192355001753454 The little rascals only understand spanking, if you ask me. Gotta give them a good beating every now and then, ground them, and assume any word they utter is drivel. They're never up to any good. Lotta energy, little reason....
6192355001753455 Indeed.
6192355001753456 Please remind me once again where the boy came from.
6192355001753457 Heard you loud and clear, doctor. Gather everyone I can find. Leave alone those who are standing their watch in suspicious spots; those ones you'll deal with personally. Let them stand there, waiting for you. What is there not to understand? All perfectly understandable.
6192355001753458 I see.
6192355001753459 There's the house, you can see it from here. Go down the path, through the brick gate, and it'll be in front of you. Street entrance.
6192355001753460 Orderly No. 6
6192355001753461 Your vigilance is commendable, Mikhail Goba. Report the situation.
6192355001753462 What do you mean, "done for"?
6192355001753463 Mikhail Goba, number two. Reporting in.\nY'know, no matter what they said, I couldn't believe you were done for... and right I was!
6192355001753464 The Judge, cancelling my orders...? What is this about?
6192355001753465 I've been told that you died of exhaustion. I don't remember who brought the news... but the rumor is that you burned yourself out. Protected us from the plague, but at the cost of your own life.\n...So some of the guys went to the Judge for further instructions. "Nothing to do here," he said, "Your place is across the river."
6192355001753466 All right, I'll deal with the Judge. Now report the situation.
6192355001753467 That's what I said too! None of his business, medicine! A smart man, that the Judge is, no arguing here; but you're the plague man. His business is power; as for the pest and other medical stuff, we are to do what you, the Bachelor, have ordered, no matter if you're alive or dead.
6192355001753468 Tell me more.
6192355001753469 Thank you. I've heard enough.
6192355001753471 Reporting in. The Dusk district, house one—there it is, to the left, with the smoking chimney—is harboring Aspity, a local quack. There's a rumor circulating that she's not susceptible to the sand pest and can cure it, too.\nHouse two, to the right. A suspicious group of children is ogling its windows. They're probably up to no good...
6192355001753472 I see... Could have guessed it myself.
6192355001753473 Thank you. Return to your duties.
6192355001753474 A semi-circle on a horizontal line, Bachelor. Means the sun setting.
6192355001753475 She needs to be deported to the other side of the river immediately. I'll talk to her myself. Ans what's wrong with the children?
6192355001753476 Sounds dangerous indeed. Good job, number two. Now go get some rest.
6192355001753477 How long has she been here...?
6192355001753478 This Aspity, or Sahba, is quite a character. It's plainly obvious what types she will attract... the infected types. Nimble, they are, swift like mice, won't be held back by any kind of barrier. You won't be able to stop them. I mean, look—they're already crowding her place! The mob was even larger at dawn.
6192355001753479 ...Drivel. Number two, do you really believe in magic like some sort of uneducated old wife? These are just children. Stop it with the obscurantism.
6192355001753480 Indeed. I don't like the sound of it. I'm not that fond of children in general. But I'll deal with the quack first. She needs to be taken away—for everyone's good.
6192355001753481 One more thing: where's your commanding orderly? Across the river?
6192355001753482 The children are not getting enough spankings, that's what's wrong with them. They don't give a rat's arse about the adults, as you have surely noticed. It's a clear sign: wherever there are kids, there is trouble. It's just the games they play—malicious games. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this whole outbreak was just a game of theirs too.
6192355001753483 I'll shove this party right up their...
6192355001753484 No. They were planning to throw a small party at the cape, by the tombs.
6192355001753485 What's wrong with the children then? You said they're ogling windows?
6192355001753486 She came last night. I mean, you've sealed the Stone Yard, so there's no sand pest here—and consequently she has few pilgrims visiting, there's no demand for her services. But still, it would be safer to get rid of her. She's looking for trouble...
6192355001753487 Orderly No. 2
6192355001753488 Where is the Judge?
6192355001753489 Can't be damned to remember your number? What's wrong with you, Likhobor? That's quite lackadaisical.
6192355001753490 ...A funeral? Who are they planning to bury?
6192355001753491 Pankrat Likhobor, Bachelor. Can't be damned to remember my number. We got two sorts of trouble here, 'n I dunno which is worse. Firstly, the steppe people. Abandoned their camp behind the Cathedral yesterday. The ones who stayed are preparing a funeral of some sorts. Secondly, the Judge has kindly gone off his rocker. Cancels your quarantine measures... and I think he harbors an infected person, too.
6192355001753492 Why in the world would they be invalid? Have you lost your marbles?
6192355001753493 I don't believe the Judge would say such things.
6192355001753494 You're being unfair, sir, what with all the big words. If I lacked anything, I wouldn't be standing here. The rest of the band went home, y'know. The Judge dismissed us 'n said all your orders were invalid.
6192355001753495 I'll have a talk with him immediately.
6192355001753496 For your vigilance, Likhobor, I assign you number one. Now go and get some rest. But don't burn the outfit, it'll come in handy still.
6192355001753497 That's what I said! The Judge has always been a decent, honest man, supported us 'n all, sir. But he wouldn't say something like this in his right mind.
6192355001753498 I'll have a word with the Judge first.
6192355001753499 I know where their camp is, you moron. It was I who ordered them relocated there.
6192355001753500 I see. Where's your commanding orderly?
6192355001753501 He's home, in the workshop. Up the stairs and to the left.\n'N don't forget them steppe people too—just follow the footpath by the Cathedral, go through the apple tree garden, you'll see the place... or at least the smoke from their fires.
6192355001753502 I see. I'll pay them a visit. Is the Judge home?
6192355001753503 One of their lot, I s'pose. Been all over the Stone Yard, looking for you. The soldiers reminded them of their place.
6192355001753504 I'll shove this party right up their...
6192355001753505 As far as I know, they were planning to throw a small party at the cape, by the tombs.
6192355001753506 Orderly No. ?
6192355001753507 Go on. I like how you're listing my achievements. More, please?
6192355001753508 Bachelor Dankovsky is ready to die.
6192355001753509 So, Bachelor Dankovsky, the founder of Thanatica—a lab where you've been fruitlessly trying to solve the problem of human mortality for too many years... the tragic sand plague fighter... are you ready to die?
6192355001753510 Was this why you sent me away to explore the town?
6192355001753511 Oh, you're a clever one... Heh. You definitely seem to have understood something.
6192355001753512 If we're having this very personal conversation at all, please be so kind as to tell me: how many days exactly are we talking here?
6192355001753513 I sent you nowhere. I came here to claim you. But I don't want to do it unless you accept me. You hate death so much that you can prolong the agony for many days, surviving purely on your own hatred. Aren't you tired of this yourself?
6192355001753514 Are you trying to tell me that when the boy woke me up...
6192355001753515 So the kids were right...
6192355001753516 Enough. You've had enough time to put yourself and your actions in perspective. Your thoughts keep coming back to your very last day time and again, as if you were trying to fix something. But in reality you are lying here, delirious, clinging to the naive hope that this terrible house is a product of your imagination—a prophetic nightmare.
6192355001753517 Give me a moment. I need to collect my thoughts.
6192355001753518 No. I refuse to. This is all a trick.
6192355001753519 ...You once again refused to die and plunged into a new loop of your deathbed derangement. Everything but this house is a product of your imagination. But now you are finally coming to. There's only one step left to make to leave the illusion behind and embrace reality. I'm afraid I'll have to be insistent. So I repeat: are you ready to die?
6192355001753520 The Judge believes that the epidemic is a sort of an exam, testing one's ability to become superhuman.
6192355001753521 Aspity the steppe woman claims that as long as we understand where death leads to, we keep on living.
6192355001753522 In the morning, you told me that you're not unlike a law of nature. A rule, so to speak, of this world. Could you please remind me though, which rules exactly we're playing by?
6192355001753523 ...Do that. Thinking is never inappropriate.
6192355001753524 I'm not Bachelor Dankovsky. You may take him. He was starting to wear on my nerves anyway.
6192355001753525 No. I like being Bachelor Dankovsky. And a prolonged agony is preferable to an inglorious end.
6192355001753526 Not "superhuman"—just "human", if I may kindly correct you. If only you understood the immeasurable vastness of humanity, you would never want to become something else. Are you ready to die, Bachelor Dankovsky?
6192355001753527 Yes. I have an idea of what's beyond this place. It's undoubtedly more intriguing. I want to break out.
6192355001753528 I want to finish what I started. Your casuistry won't trick me. I will keep fighting death—and will see it through.
6192355001753529 Sahba-ötün is so cute... So used to nurturing little children and cubs. She begged me to take it easy on you. Said you're like a baby, who lacks the right words. Can you feel it, at least? Do you know in what direction you want to live?
6192355001753530 I deny you the right to exist. I'm the one in control.
6192355001753531 You're not death. You're merely a puppet. It was I who brought you to life—and it is I who will end it.
6192355001753532 Are you ready to die, beakhead?
6192355001753533 What on earth...?
6192355001753534 Keep vigil over my body? What do you mean?
6192355001753535 Yes, the kids grew very fond of you. They keep vigil over your body—even fighting over the privilege of fetching water for you. The girl is the only one smart enough to realize that it's time your torture ended... But adults always underestimate children. Think they are more intelligent. And you are no exception.
6192355001753536 Solve the same problem in my real life, when the time comes.
6192355001753537 Just live on. Rest in peace.
6192355001753538 I don't know. I haven't decided yet. But thank you kindly for the enlightening conversation.
6192355001753539 Touché. Bravo, Bachelor. ...Or are you? It's hard to tell who exactly talks to me from the other side of the glass... what a cumbersome mask. Anyway. What do you plan to do now?
6192355001753540 ...
6192355001753541 You chose freedom. Congratulations.\nGive me your hand. Now the interesting part begins.
6192355001753542 Yes. I'll stay here until the end.
6192355001753543 I merely don't want to die.
6192355001753544 So you want to repeat this circle once again. Well. The choice was yours to make.
6192355001753545 ...
6192355001753546 Now close your eyes. When you open them, a boy called Sticky will wake you up, and the Stone Yard will once again be free of infection. Perhaps this time you'll manage to prepare yourself for the inevitable.\n\nSee you soon.
6192355001753547 Yes. I refuse to die.
6192355001753548 Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm very fond of thinking. You can say it's a hobby of mine. Never miss an opportunity to think some more when the chance presents itself.
6192355001753549 So you refuse to die. Are you sure you thought this through?
6192355001753550 Why should you care? Just reap what needs reaping.
6192355001753551 Hard to please, aren't you?
6192355001753552 ...No. No. This is not what I meant. This is not how you were supposed to die.
6192355001753553 And yet... This is my fault, isn't it? Do what you must.
6192355001753554 Yeah, I agree that the attempt was lousy. Would you let me try again?
6192355001753555 Think about it. "Are you ready to die?" This is what the question was. The wording is important here.\nYou're dying. But you aren't ready. What's the point of such death? You never braved the abyss; you fell limply down its chasm.
6192355001753556 The Executor
6192355001753557 And my job is making sure you remember them well. I'm all ears.
6192355001753558 If the local populace keeps roaming the streets without a care in the world, "educating" them won't do much. Why do they act as though nothing happened?
6192355001753559 I'm standing my watch, doctor. As per your instructions.\nMy job is to educate the local populace on the required precaution measures in times of an outbreak.
6192355001753560 Recite the instructions.
6192355001753561 We're understaffed. We can't make them stay in—we can only educate them. Although in my humble opinion, sir, it's all pointless now anyway. Walls won't protect anyone from the pest... poisoned air doesn't care about walls. And rats are omnipresent, too.
6192355001753562 Uh huh. Go on.
6192355001753563 ...Only they're unavailable.
6192355001753564 Immunity is key. This is our main defense, our tough armor. As long as it's high, there is a chance to escape unscathed.\nBut infection gnaws at it. When it becomes low, it's time to take immunity boosters. A-pills.
6192355001753565 All right. Go on.
6192355001753566 There were some at the drugstore. And in personal stocks too... if you manage to get to one. All in all, they're obtainable. It's hard, but doable.
6192355001753567 Such as...?
6192355001753568 The air itself is dangerous. Or, to be more precise, the black particles it's filled with are. They are what wears out the immunity.\nHowever, if you're already infected, it stops being a hazard. When you're infected, you need to keep an eye on other things...
6192355001753569 Go on.
6192355001753570 Indeed. One must keep a close eye on their infection level. The lower, the better. Please try to hammer this thought into everyone's heads.
6192355001753571 The things that exacerbate your condition, obviously. Being touched by infected people. The mobile clots of airborne infection, the so-called "plague's breaths."\nThe more infected you are, the faster you're dying.
6192355001753572 Go on.
6192355001753573 Correction: There are problematic rumors circulating about some sorts of magical cures that can actually rid a person from the sand pest completely. I hope you root this hearsay out?
6192355001753574 The level of infection is decreased by antibiotics... but they're also harmful for your health. We forbid the populace from taking too much of them, that can lead to a fatal outcome. In any case, if the infection has already found its way into your body, antibiotics cannot erase it completely.
6192355001753575 Well, I find this chase disruptive! This data is untested and unverified. It's no good giving people false hope. Go on.
6192355001753576 Children's powders... are children considered luminaries of medicine now? If anyone here needs to be firmly grounded, it's the children!
6192355001753577 As a matter of fact... If you insist, sir, we will quell these rumors. But... they say it works, doctor. Using steppe traditional practices, Burakh has created a panacea. And children's powders work too. There have been cases of people getting miraculously cured. Everyone's chasing them for a reason.
6192355001753578 Well done. As you were.
6192355001753579 No. That's not all. You forgot to mention that a person who wants to actually do something needs to stock on painkillers. Morphine reduces pain, giving the illusion of health restoration... even though it's temporary.
6192355001753580 What else... Immunity aside, thick clothing also protects from infection. Which is why we wear these outfits that even cover faces. I think that's all.
6192355001753581 What kinds of orders?
6192355001753582 I don't know. I'll drop by them and check.
6192355001753583 No. There is no committee anymore. Ignore them.
6192355001753584 Whatever. It can't get any worse.
6192355001753585 Oh, and one more thing, sir. The anti-epidemic committee at the Crucible keeps on working, as far as I know.\nBut we're receiving weird contradictory orders from them. Should we still follow them?
6192355001753586 Have they gone insane? I'll check it out.
6192355001753587 Indeed. All these guidelines were approved by me. Get on with them.
6192355001753588 Ahem... to breed cats. To take beds and bunks outside. To put small bells atop graves. To bury the dead in the most notable and visible places. Not an hour goes by without them issuing a new guideline.
6192355001753589 I was too late...This is it then.
6192355001753590 Do I hear delight in your voice, orderly...?
6192355001753591 Here it is, doctor! Here it finally is. You were right all along.\nSo here we are, standing our watch once again. Awaiting your wise orders.
6192355001753592 ...Told to? By whom?
6192355001753593 The Stone Yard was the last clean district. Now everything is surely lost.
6192355001753594 No. We need to find a way to withstand the outbreak now. Perhaps someone will survive.\n"Nothing is over yet. This is just the beginning." This is what I've been told to relay to you.
6192355001753595 Death is a lousy employee... and way too willful a partner.
6192355001753596 I'll make sure to thank them, whoever they are... as soon as I get there.
6192355001753597 We deal in death, Bachelor. We have our own sources. Some of them, on the other side.
6192355001753598 ...And who is the smart-alec that is so eager to tell me how to live my life?
6192355001753599 Dum spiro spero... Latin is as lousy at curing despair as medicine is at curing death.
6192355001753600 I'll try that. It's not like I have anything else left to do.
6192355001753601 But you are still alive. While there is life, there is hope. I've been told to relay that to you.
6192355001753602 Orderly
6192355001753603 Oh, you're dead wrong. I will leave this place and I will summon orderlies.
6192355001753604 Damn it to hell... You're right... I'm at an impasse.
6192355001753605 ...Do you have a gun in this house, I wonder? With three bullets?
6192355001753606 You must be thinking that you can't leave this place now. But don't let it get to you.
6192355001753607 There's only one solution for the infected. Death.
6192355001753608 I'm almost curious now. So tell me, what is the answer then?
6192355001753609 No. It won't solve anything. The solution is not where you think it is. The answer is not what you think it is.
6192355001753610 Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, darling. I'm far from kind.
6192355001753611 What makes you think I'm scared? I'm satisfied. I've finally found what I've been looking for.
6192355001753612 Indeed. Death may feel horrible, but it's not the end. Fear nothing and be on your way, kind doctor.
6192355001753613 Are you trying to convince me that the infected become immortal? Nice try.
6192355001753614 Aren't you scared at all...?
6192355001753615 You think that if we stay confined in this eggshell, the town will survive? Perhaps it will. Not that you'll have a chance to see it.\nBut if you stay here, with us, you will only find pointless demise. Eternal wait... For now we know that we are immortal.
6192355001753616 Siskin
6192355001753617 Believer
6192355001753632 Perhaps this place gives them more food for thought than the outside.
6192355001753633 I didn't come here to indulge in philosophizing, you buffoon. I just did what had to be done.
6192355001753634 I'm not wise, just diligent.
6192355001753635 Blessed is the dead who thinks he is alive. Why hurt their idyll? That would be too cruel. ...You are a wise man, Bachelor. If they want to live through this evil day again and again... who are we to rob them of their bliss—the chance to take non-existence for existence?
6192355001753636 Same here. Curious indeed.
6192355001753637 I'm a doctor. I know full well that they don't have much time left. The lad's case in particular doesn't look good... and, honestly, the girl's isn't much better.
6192355001753638 I took pity on them. Had a hunch that they'd simply perish here. As for out there, who knows...
6192355001753639 You did the right thing, doctor. They left this place while completely assured that they were going to die. To overcome the fear of death is a great achievement. Who knows? Perhaps this particular act of bravery is exactly what saved their lives. I'd be curious to follow their fates. Thank you.
6192355001753640 Clockworker
6192355001753641 You're exactly who I've been looking for. There are two infected people in that house. Thank heavens, I found them in time. You know what to do.
6192355001753642 Firstly, I need a team of orderlies here, stat. Board off the house. Don't let anyone out... myself included. I'm staying in there. I have contracted the disease.
6192355001753645 Mikhail Goba, orderly No. 2. Awaiting your command, doctor...
6192355001753646 It's plainly obvious.
6192355001753647 You have been briefed. You know what to do. Why are you hanging around here?
6192355001753648 Burn this pungent nest. The carrier was here, right inside.
6192355001753649 If I may... The infection has infiltrated the Stone Yard. The outbreak is gaining momentum. 
6192355001753650 ...No. No. Anything but this. Please tell me you're talking about a revolution, fire, or military coup. Please.
6192355001753651 Do you have hearing issues? The one with the unfortunate news is me. There are infected people in this house! Now get on with your duties!
6192355001753652 I come bearing unfortunate news, Bachelor...
6192355001753653 So I was too late.
6192355001753654 ...How did it happen?
6192355001753655 I'm sorry, Bachelor Dankovsky. The infection has infiltrated the Stone Yard. The outbreak is gaining momentum. \nAwaiting your command.
6192355001753656 ...How many refugees were there?
6192355001753657 A sizable group of refugees from across the river has found its way here tonight. They entered the Stone Yard through the steppe people's camp back behind the Cathedral. That's probably the reason why most of the steppe rabble fled at night. They feared the disease... or maybe your wrath.
6192355001753658 ...This is it then.
6192355001753659 Enough. More importantly, they've gone into hiding all over the place. We won't apprehend them all before dark.
6192355001753660 I doubt it.
6192355001753661 ...Yes. Even if in the end there is but a single living person left, we still need to fight tooth and claw for every life. At least that's how the theory goes. The reality is much ungainlier though...
6192355001753662 Now we need to persevere. To stand up to the plague. Perhaps someone will survive.
6192355001753663 I think I'm beginning to understand. I believe I have a crucial appointment this evening. I just need to survive until I can attend it.
6192355001753664 Not for long.
6192355001753665 How does this matter in the slightest now?
6192355001753666 But you are still alive.
6192355001753667 Seriously? You've breathed new life into me, mate. I'm all aglow.
6192355001753668 ...Told to? By whom?
6192355001753669 The beginning of the end. This town is done for. Yet I will try to make it until the evening to have a word with a certain someone...
6192355001753670 "Nothing is over yet. This is just the beginning." This is what I've been told to relay to you.
6192355001753671 I'll make sure to thank them, whoever they are... as soon as I get there.
6192355001753672 The only competent source of information you have is me. And I regret to inform you that this town is done for.
6192355001753673 We deal in death, Bachelor. We have our own sources. Some of them, on the other side.
6192355001753674 Oh really?
6192355001753675 I've seen them with my own eyes. I know what I'm talking about, mate.
6192355001753676 As you wish, sir. But, if I may, you are mistaken.
6192355001753677 Orderly No. 2
6192355001753681 Tagtaa
6192355001753687 I'll do what I can.
6192355001753688 We'll see.
6192355001753689 He needs to live. Let him suffer. Just not die today.
6192355001753690 How can anyone deal with you people and preserve their sanity?! What happened...?
6192355001753691 Never seen better...
6192355001753692 Everything will be good now. We are grateful to you.
6192355001753693 You are an insane, barbaric people! How can you live with yourself?!
6192355001753694 So this is what kind of wedding you were celebrating...! Why oh why didn't I listen to the poor wounded guy...
6192355001753695 She was a herb bride. Brides join Earth in wedlock, so that others may live.\nIt means no one else will die today. You are the doctor. We did this for you.
6192355001753696 Yeah, it's Greek to me...
6192355001753697 If only it was so simple. But I doubt that millions of dying people would agree with you.
6192355001753698 We fear neither pain nor death. One is immortal while the kin lives.\nYou wouldn't understand.
6192355001753699 Are you talking about the plague...? What does it have to do with the earth?
6192355001753700 You don't care about your husband's life at all, do you?
6192355001753701 If there'd been mourning, the celebration would have been cancelled. If the celebration had been cancelled, the earth would have gone unfed.\nWhen the earth isn't fed, it feeds itself. And that would be far worse. No one would be saved.
6192355001753702 You've suffered a great loss. I'm sorry.
6192355001753703 Doctors don't always win in their duels with death.
6192355001753704 Really? Why?
6192355001753705 Well. No one will be saved now...
6192355001753706 I'm sorry.
6192355001753707 I learned of this place too late.
6192355001753708 Mother Boddho gives us no respite. The earth is calling. Such is our fate then.\nFrom the soil we came, and to the soil we return. As for you, go. We need to prepare ourselves.
6192355001753709 Herb Bride
6192355001753710 Evicted? How? Why?
6192355001753711 I suspect you are mistaken. Each household was provided three days' worth of food for the isolation period. The bare minimum. So I very much doubt there are any eatables left anywhere.
6192355001753712 People were evicted from three houses yesterday. They must have left food behind. When is it going to be distributed?
6192355001753713 And where were the evicted people relocated, I wonder? It's not like there are spare houses in the Stone Yard. When we were trying to accommodate the refugees from across the river, people were packed like sardines. Some of them even had to sleep outside.
6192355001753714 Perhaps you're right, there may be food left there. I'll take a look. Which particular houses are you talking about? Who do they belong to?
6192355001753715 I don't know. But there may be goods inside, and those houses stand deserted anyway. So why won't they let us in?
6192355001753716 I want to take a look personally. Where are these houses? They're guarded, I should hope?
6192355001753717 No. It won't happen anytime soon. You'll have to be patient.
6192355001753718 I don't know, doctor. The owners are told to have gone back across the river. The whole ordeal's over, isn't it? By the way, does this mean that our own guests will also be evicted soon?
6192355001753719 I've forbidden everyone to go outside. Yourself included. But my words seem to fall on deaf ears...
6192355001753720 Soldiers, huh... Well, that's reassuring at least. The last thing we need is looting.
6192355001753721 I don't know. Rumor has it, there are soldiers standing watch by them. Even if there's no food left inside, perhaps we can at least relocate some refugees there?\nI mean really, doctor! My own house is so packed, there's no room to swing a cat! And you've forbidden them to go outside, too...
6192355001753722 Confused Woman
6192355001753723 What was the precise wording of the order?
6192355001753724 I'm the one giving orders around here.
6192355001753725 The building is off limits, doctor. I was ordered not to let anyone in.
6192355001753726 Whose brilliant idea was that?
6192355001753727 Good. Stand your guard, soldier.
6192355001753728 No one is allowed inside. If someone somehow sneaks in, they are to stay in.\nIf anyone doesn't comply, we are allowed to open fire.
6192355001753729 Indeed, the instructions were mine. Meaning these orders do not apply to me. Let me in.
6192355001753730 There is a back door, huh?
6192355001753731 The order follows your own instructions, sir. That's what Captain Longin said: doctor's orders, no exceptions. Full isolation.\nSome hothead sneaked in through the back door this morning... and won't ever return. Whatever he may have stolen, he took to the grave.
6192355001753732 Sure, I don't want you to get into trouble. I'll try the other door.
6192355001753733 Currying favors, huh? Whatever.
6192355001753734 I'm in the Captain's bad books already, doctor. One more slip-up, and he'll do me in, won't even waste time on a court martial.\nThe orders are strict and precise. If you want to try climbing up the window, go ahead. I'll look the other way. But don't ask me to break the chain of command directly. I won't.
6192355001753735 Soldier
6192355001753736 ...What?
6192355001753737 How did you get in here? Are you the looter?
6192355001753738 You need to look it in the eye. Face to face.
6192355001753739 You must be deranged with fear, kind sir. What in the world are you talking about?
6192355001753740 Does this house have a second exit?
6192355001753741 Bravo. Turns out defeating death is really simple. And here I was, wasting years on this challenge...
6192355001753742 Listen. If you can hear it, that means it's close; that means you must muster up your courage and look it in the eye. \nThen it will freeze.... for a while. And you'll get a chance to move forward.
6192355001753743 I never have.
6192355001753744 Only brave children believe that the monster won't touch them if they hide under the pillow.\nBut that won't save you. Do not deny the obvious. Do not turn your back on it.
6192355001753745 Indeed. I'm rather short on the latter.
6192355001753746 All right... I'll take a look around.
6192355001753747 You don't understand. I was speaking literally. No metaphors.\nFace death. Don't turn your back to it. Find yourself. Waste no time.
6192355001753748 "Find myself"? What am I, thirteen?
6192355001753749 Don't test my patience. I'm asking you again: is there a way out of here?
6192355001753750 You need to find yourself. Then it'll leave you be...
6192355001753751 I know that perfectly well...
6192355001753752 We're locked in! And I don't think they'll let us out... What shall we do?
6192355001753753 To dance with death, you need to face it. Death is a beast of prey. Never turn your back on it.
6192355001753754 No it isn't.
6192355001753755 Metaphors... You know, I've never been a huge fan of literature.
6192355001753756 You won't defeat it. But you can move forward. That is how the world works.
6192355001753757 A perfect place for a rehearsal. What happened here?
6192355001753758 Go on then. Sorry for interrupting you.
6192355001753759 No. I'm an actor. We're having a rehearsal here.
6192355001753760 I know. It's called "autosuggestion."
6192355001753761 Uh huh. Also I need to do some self-searching. I remember, my straightforward friend.
6192355001753762 In's on the walls.\nListen closely. Watch closely. And if you see its face, don't turn away.
6192355001753763 Tragedian
6192355001753764 Where's everyone?
6192355001753765 What's in there?
6192355001753766 Inspecting the site, doctor? There's no one here. One civilian got in—and in he stayed. ...He shouted and shouted and shouted and then he didn't.
6192355001753767 Why were they evicted in the first place?
6192355001753768 No one's reporting that to us. Some people say they've been sent back across the river; other, that they were just relocated to other houses.
6192355001753769 Indeed. I'm afraid I've found the thing I was looking for...
6192355001753770 Keep your watch and stay alert. Constant vigilance, remember?
6192355001753771 Must be something scary inside. Perhaps the tenants found it. Dunno. Hence me asking—are you here to inspect the place?
6192355001753772 Soldier
6192355001753792 Lockpicks?
6192355001753793 Are you all insane? Bloody hell, I never ordered to shoot kids!
6192355001753794 Finally you're here, doctor! I just shooed a bunch of children away. They tried to sneak in... I seized lockpicks from them, too. Didn't find the heart to shoot, sir. Forgive me. They're just children, after all.
6192355001753795 Hand them over.
6192355001753796 Why were the residents of the house evicted?
6192355001753797 Well, sir, kids often ferret about empty flats. And the owners of this house were evicted. Here, sir, the two lockpicks I confiscated.\nBut they still got more. They'll never back off... I know what I'm talking about, sir, I was just like that myself.
6192355001753798 No, you're not.
6192355001753799 Yes. Go.
6192355001753800 For some reason... People from the Crucible came by, told them to vacate the premises. I dunno, sir, I was only assigned to this duty this morning.\nAm I dismissed, sir?
6192355001753801 Guard
6192355001753802 Leaving fingerprints is ill-advised.
6192355001753803 Leather Gloves
6192355001753804 Protective handwear. The local leatherworks is a less-known branch of Fat Vlad's Bull Project.
6192355001753808 Folks here believe that any affliction can be smothered in bandages, and any decently soft cloth can serve as one. Makes one wonder how people with such advanced medical knowledge even get sick at all.
6192355001753809 Bandage
6192355001753810 Improves health. Stop bleeding, and you stop death—or delay it, at least. 
6192355001753811 Powders, or "shmowders," as the kids call them, can sometimes cure any disease. Or at least they used to. Khan, the children's leader who now rules the Polyhedron, claims that all the real "shmowders" were used up long before the epidemic.
6192355001753812 The box seems to be filled with powder made of assorted ground pills.
6192355001753813 Powder
6192355001753814 Often used an an offering to the dead, milk serves as a reminder that all that is born must come to an end. It's so popular in the Town that cream separators can be found even in households that seem to have nothing to do with the local Bull Project.
6192355001753815 Milk
6192355001753816 Warm, creamy. Satisfies hunger and thirst. Often offered to the dead.
6192355001753820 The rumor that General Block, the chief commanding officer of the soldiers deployed to the Town, hanged himself on a noose made of tourniquets rather than succumb to the disease, is absurd and unfounded. This rubber band can't support the weight of a grown man.
6192355001753821 Tourniquet
6192355001753822 Rubber tourniquets are regarded as poor quality by the townsfolk, who prefer the locally made leather ones.
6192355001753823 Fresh water is brought to the Town daily from a spring in the steppe and distributed among the households by water bearers. The Gorkhon water has been proven to be clean, but the locals refuse to drink it.
6192355001753824 Seemingly sates thirst a bit. Despite the Town standing on the river Gorkhon, fresh drinking water is a rare commodity here.
6192355001753825 Water Bottle
6192355001753826 A basic protective item that covers the face.
6192355001753827 Common among medical personnel, this mask quickly accumulates infection and becomes a hazard itself. It also muffles speech. Still, better than nothing.
6192355001753828 Face Mask
6192355001753829 A surprising find in autumn, if not useless.
6192355001753830 I used to collect these as a kid. Left the collection with my father.
6192355001753831 Beetle
6192355001753832 One vial can't save the Town—but it can save someone. If only I figure out what it's made of…
6192355001753833 "Panacea"
6192355001753834 …So Artemy Burakh did manage to make a cure for sand pest after all.
6192355001753838 Man needs dreams more than bread... but he still needs the bread.
6192355001753839 Bread
6192355001753840 Bread is the heart of life. No food is more filling.
6192355001753841 Scientifically speaking, there's no consensus on if immunity can be boosted at all. However, these pills work well. According to the box, they were manufactured more than fifty years ago.
6192355001753842 Immunity Boosters
6192355001753843 Assorted pills of unknown origin. Boost immunity. Smell suspicious.
6192355001753844 Secondhand soldier boots, covered in reddish-black stains on the inside. Offer decent protection.
6192355001753845 The army was deployed to the Town to reinforce the quarantine measures almost by accident—or so it seems to an outsider. These sturdy boots came with the 4th Division, gaining immediate popularity.
6192355001753846 Boots
6192355001753847 Orderlies—the volunteer medical assistants—use these costumes borrowed from the local theatre as protective cloaks. This is the traditional costume of the Reaper, an allegory of Death.
6192355001753848 Executor Cloak
6192355001753849 Protects against infection during contact. The pendants serve no obvious purpose, but tearing them off would be a waste of time.
6192355001753850 A warm heart that went out to people. Literally.
6192355001753851 In the steppe lore, the center of mind and knowledge is the liver, while the center of feeling and emotion is the lower guts. They view the heart as a less crucial and rather mechanical organ that simply pumps life around, oddly arriving at a consensus with science-based medicine.
6192355001753852 Heart
6192355001753853 Protective footwear. Helps one rise above their troubles—and the poisoned earth.
6192355001753854 Cothurni—unusual footwear that elevates the wearer high above the ground—are popular with the local theatre. It's likely the orderlies owe their awe-inspiring height to them.
6192355001753855 Cothurni
6192355001753867 Chest of Drawers
6192355001753868 Chest
6192355001753869 Small Cabinet
6192355001753870 Chest
6192355001753871 Broken window
6192355001753872 Small Cabinet
6192355001753873 Cabinet
6192355001753875 Cabinet
6192355001753877 Small Cabinet
6192355001753878 Small Cabinet
6192355001753879 Chest of Drawers
6192355001753880 Wardrobe
6192355001753881 Table
6192355001753882 A Focus can be held by an object of any size: a Polyhedron, a room, a nut.
6192355001753883 Walnuts
6192355001753884 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355001753885 Nutritious, neat, and well-preserved food that somehow doesn't require a can opener. There's no manufacturer listed on the label, and it's unclear what kind of food is inside.
6192355001753886 Canned Food
6192355001753887 The can is entirely sealed, so its contents are free of infection. The food itself is quite nutritious.
6192355001753888 Healing herbs placed inside the beak overwhelm all other smells. Protects against disease clouds.
6192355001753889 The mask of Muu Shubuun, "the wicked bird." Part of the Reaper costume from the local theatre. It doesn't have eyeholes: the mask is mounted above an actor's head, who peeks through a hole in the cloak.
6192355001753890 Executor Mask
6192355001753893 Peanuts
6192355001753894 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355001753895 A Focus can be held by an object of any size: a Polyhedron, a room, a nut.
6192355001753896 It's cold.
6192355001753897 It reflects light at odd angles, making its true size difficult to discern.
6192355001753898 Key
6192355001753899 Used Bandage
6192355001753900 According to sanitary procedures, any object that bears the trace of a deceased person's blood must be burned. According to local belief, it's pointless since the blood will simply appear elsewhere.
6192355001753901 Traces of the epidemic are omnipresent.
6192355001753902 Package
6192355001753903 Contains useful but unknown items. Unfold to extract them.
6192355001753904 Long before the current socioeconomic catastrophe, the local townsfolk developed a tradition of barter that the whole community reveled in. This includes many types, such as "tit for tat" and "retrab." It is sometimes secret, with people swapping wrapped items blindly.
6192355001753905 Match
6192355001753906 Draw the short one!
6192355001753907 One must recall that which is most dear to them <i>before</i> the match burns out, or the whole thing won't work.
6192355001753908 Spindle
6192355001753909 It has almost run out of thread.
6192355001753910 More likely to poke your eye out than prick your finger.
6192355001753911 Broken Scissors
6192355001753912 The Moerae must have been in a hurry—too many threads to cut.
6192355001753913 It's said that Clara the Changeling, a thief girl who claims to be a saint, can repair any sharp object just as easily as she cures the sand pest, simply by laying her hands on it. Maybe this is why people refuse to throw away useless junk like broken scissors.
6192355001753914 Panacea
6192355001753915 A run-of-the-mill medicine vial filled with clotty reddish liquid that smells vaguely of spices. It seems distantly familiar.
6192355001753916 Shortly before his tragic demise, Artemy Burakh, a local medicine man, claimed to have produced a miraculous cure capable of eliminating the sand plague completely from one's body. Until now, his claims remained unproven. This may be the only sample in existence.
6192355001753917 Raisins
6192355001753918 Once juicy berries, now a luxurious treat with a sugary aftertaste.
6192355001753919 The locals refuse to eat more than a handful. Perhaps this is because raisins don't spoil, making them a valuable treat in times of famine.
6192355001753920 Broke Ampoule
6192355001753921 People would use any and all means to cure themselves of the disease.
6192355001753922 An ampoule that once contained either life-saving, or life-ending, medicine. It served its purpose—whatever it was—and is now useless.
6192355001753923 Lockpick
6192355001753924 Twisted and uneven, the local lockpicks require a fast, jabbing motion to unlock a door, else they'll become uncoiled.
6192355001753925 It's said that Clara the Changeling, a thief girl who claims to be a saint, can open any door just as easily as she heals the sick, simply by laying her hands on it. Why are her pockets always filled with lockpicks, then?
6192355001753926 Toast
6192355001753927 Soldier food. There's no reason to prefer it to freshly baked bread.
6192355001753928 Letting bread turn stale is frowned upon. Toast arrived to the Town with soldiers' rations and remains undesirable, despite being filling.
6192355001753929 Recently stopped, so the original owner has most likely died.
6192355001753930 Time doesn't seem to work properly in the Town. There's no other explanation for how Georgiy Kain, the Judge, is twice as young as his twin brother. The Kains' love for clockwork is surely connected.
6192355001753931 Pocket Watch
6192355001753932 Candle Stub
6192355001753933 The stub of a nuptial candle. It smells of earth.
6192355001753934 Eva Yan, the mistress of the Stillwater, often burned candles to give her mansion a cozier appearance during the night, less like an observatory.\n\nYet, now it's dark.
6192355001753935 Morphine
6192355001753936 A person is only alive for as long as they feel pain. Morphine makes you numb to it, seemingly increasing health.
6192355001753937 Unsuccessfully banned within the Town by Governor Saburov, in an attempt to alleviate his wife's addiction. Morphine relieves a person of pain, worries, and worldly desires, leaving them drowsy and numb.
6192355001753938 Money
6192355001753939 Used to buy items in shops. Offering it during common street barter, however, would be taken as offensive.
6192355001753940 On the third day of the epidemic, local prices soared. Now, on the eighth day, money has lost all meaning, and people prefer barter instead. It may be inconvenient, but it can be lucrative.
6192355001753941 Bull Bell
6192355001753942 Bells like this are often hung above graves, in case of lethargy.
6192355001753943 The inner surface of this bell is painted with the sigils of the secret, sacred steppe alphabet. It's the knowledge of this alphabet that allowed Artemy Burakh, a local medicine man, to restore his rightful place in the steppe community, shortly before his death.
6192355001753944 Fishing Hooks
6192355001753945 Sharp objects are regarded as dangerous and thus frowned on by the locals.
6192355001753946 While the Gorkhon river has plenty of fish, fishing is unpopular among the locals. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that hooks are sharp objects—heavily frowned upon around here.
6192355001753947 Despite the lack of chestnut trees around, chestnuts are everywhere in the Town. Where do they come from?
6192355001753948 Chestnut
6192355001753949 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355001753951 Cash Register
6192355001753952 Container
6192355001753953 Marbles
6192355001753954 Children give them names and believe they hold memories, as though they are alive.
6192355001753955 No one knows how marbles appear in the Town. No one makes or delivers them. They simply pop up here and there; on the floor, under the pillow, or right on the ground.

6192355001788753 The sand plague has infiltrated the town. The source or carrier has to be around. Where?
6192355001788754 The source or carrier do not matter. What matters is finding the way to beat the disease. How can it be done?
6192355001788755 It's not the plague I'm fighting. The plague is but a guise. Who is my true foe?
6192355001789451 A patient is waiting for an examination here. Flat 3.\nIs it the sand pest...?
6192355001789452 The orderlies are having a celebration.
6192355001789453 The shop
6192355001789454 The local Cathedral served as a refuge for the people who exhibited suspicious signs
6192355001789455 The steppe people are preparing for a funeral
6192355001789456 The drugstore
6192355001789457 Here, an odd house piqued children's curiosity. Something feels off.
6192355001789458 The Crucible. Judge Georgiy Kain lives here
6192355001789459 The anti-epidemic committee. The place to take day-to-day concerns to.
6192355001789460 "The Stillwater. Uninhabited due to its owner's suicide.\nDoes the house mourn her passing?"
6192355001789461 An odd woman, possible quack, who is told to have found the cure for the plague, lives here
6192355001789462 The local actors are staging a mime play in front of the Cathedral
6192355001789463 The town's attention seems to be directed here

6192355001825453 [Doesn't seem like the sand pest, but there's no harm in double-checking. Better safe than sorry.]
6192355001825454 Nothing for a doctor to do here. Call gravediggers.
6192355001825455 I'm sorry, lad. You are coming with me. I'll take care of you.
6192355001825456 [The symptoms do not fit the horrible disease that's exterminated two thirds of the town's population in a week.\nJudging by the preliminary analysis, the man died of a massive stroke.]
6192355001825457 I still think we should perform an autopsy. I'll call the orderlies, they'll take the body where it belongs.
6192355001825458 Your father didn't die of the sand plague. False alarm... he had a stroke. 
6192355001825951 
6192355001825952 
6192355001825953 
6192355001825967 
6192355001825968 
6192355001825969 
6192355001825970 
6192355001826151 
6192355001826651 
6192355001826655 
6192355001826851 
6192355001826852 This is it, doctor. You fought valiantly, but you've lost. A foe like me is no match for men, and you are no exception. \nSo, are you ready to die?
6192355001826853 No. That is not what I intend to do.
6192355001826854 Yes. I'm ready.
6192355001826855 Good. Finally you understand. I really hope that you do—for your own sake; otherwise, this is where it all ends.
6192355001826856 Who knows...
6192355001826857 Not for me.
6192355001826860 Most people would simply cease to be at this point. Few would make a step beyond. Let's see who you are. Give me your hand.
6192355001826861 Here it is.
6192355001826862 Let's see.
6192355001826863 That's enough. I don't care.
6192355001826864 So you didn't understand anything... Stubborn man. \nYou've done more than is humanly possible. You've cordoned off the safe part of the town. But it was all in vain. I'm here already.
6192355001826865 I don't believe you. This is all a dream. A nightmare.
6192355001826866 A prophetic dream, Bachelor. Such is the nature of the plague. \nThe town seems clean and calm in the morning. But somewhere in the depths of a nondescript house a carrier is already lurking. Come noon, fleas appear in hordes, transmitting the sickness. So do rats. By the evening, the whole town is in agony. You've seen this many times already. \nSo, are you ready to die?
6192355001826867 No. Don't even try. Soon I'll wake up, and you'll be gone.
6192355001826868 If what you're saying is true... then yes, I am.
6192355001826869 No. You may not see me at once, but that doesn't mean I won't be there. I'm telling you, I'm already in this part of the town. Please understand that resistance is pointless. You need to come to terms with my existence and accept me, like you accept the law of gravity. I am earth. We are of the same nature. Are you ready to die, Bachelor?
6192355001826870 No. Fighting death is my job.
6192355001826871 Well... Praemonitus praemunitus. If you've infiltrated the Stone Yard already, all I need to do is find you. 
6192355001826872 You've been studying death all your life, yet the understanding of its nature still eludes you. Like a child, you're squeezing your eyes shut to hide from the monster.
6192355001826873 No, I'm not. If you are truly already here, then hide all you want. Here I come.
6192355001826874 As you wish. In that case, go and see for yourself.
6192355001826875 ...
6192355001826876 Begone, Plague. Out of my way.
6192355001827051 
6192355001827251 The sand plague has infiltrated the Town. The source, or the carrier, must be around. Where?
6192355001827252 The source, or the carrier, does not matter. What matters is discovering how to defeat the disease. How can it be done?
6192355001827253 This is not a fight against the plague. The plague is only a facade. Who is my true foe?
6192355001827254 
6192355001827255 
6192355001827256 Most orderlies have abandoned the Stone Yard. Few remain on duty.
6192355001827257 Someone's spreading a rumor that I'm dead.
6192355001827258 
6192355001827259 
6192355001827260 The orderlies have registered me as among the deceased. Someone will pay for this sick joke.
6192355001827261 
6192355001827262 
6192355001827263 The Judge paid me a visit this night while I was still asleep.
6192355001827264 Georgiy Kain is lifting the quarantine.
6192355001827265 
6192355001827266 
6192355001827267 The Judge is seemingly the only person around who doesn't believe that the outbreak has been curbed.
6192355001827268 
6192355001827269 
6192355001827270 The Judge claims that death is not the end, but rather a test waiting to be passed by every person.
6192355001827271 
6192355001827272 
6192355001827273 A suspicious crowd has gathered by one of the houses in the Dusk district.
6192355001827274 The suspicious visitors of a house in the Dusk district claim that they've come to see a dream-teller.
6192355001827275 According to the dream-teller, death can be proper or improper. She promised to teach me how to die right.
6192355001827276 
6192355001827277 
6192355001827278 When one dies properly, they are greeted by something other than non-existence beyond the threshold. But how does one die properly?
6192355001827279 I cannot die right now. Whatever waits for me on the other side, I simply cannot afford to take risks.
6192355001827282 
6192355001827283 
6192355001827284 A boy named Sticky implores me to not give nuts to a girl named Shrew, not under any circumstances.
6192355001827286 Sticky would go as far as to buy nuts from me, trading them for useful items like bandages.
6192355001827287 
6192355001827288 
6192355001827289 A girl named Shrew claims I promised to bring her nuts a while ago.
6192355001827290 Shrew would trade nuts for lockpicks, which are the only way to get inside a suspicious house.
6192355001827291 
6192355001827292 
6192355001827293 I traded nuts to Sticky.
6192355001827294 I traded nuts to Shrew.
6192355001827295 
6192355001827296 
6192355001827297 According to Shrew, I'm delirious, hallucinating yesterday's events… and not for the first time. The kind girl wants my misery to end.
6192355001827298 According to Shrew, I'm delirious, hallucinating yesterday's events… and not for the first time. My young friend plays doctor, not wanting me to abandon the game.
6192355001827299 
6192355001827300 
6192355001827301 The tragedians believe that I have no heart.
6192355001827302 I have a heart now. Perhaps the tragedians would like to have a look.
6192355001827303 I misinterpreted the tragedians.
6192355001827304 
6192355001827305 
6192355001827306 A terrible appointment awaits me this evening. No matter what, one shouldn't play by the rules, not even the rules of this very game.
6192355001827307 
6192355001827308 
6192355001827309 There is a sick person in Neck, 1.
6192355001827310 Not the plague. The man has died of a stroke.
6192355001827311 
6192355001827312 
6192355001827313 The local Cathedral served as a refuge for those who showed suspicious signs.
6192355001827314 I cannot diagnose the couple in the Cathedral.
6192355001827315 
6192355001827316 
6192355001827317 Not all odonghs have left for the steppe.
6192355001827318 An odongh is on the brink of death. But he can't be operated on without supplies.
6192355001827319 The Hippocratic oath was observed, but it wasn't plague.
6192355001827320 The steppe creature hasn't survived the operation. In any case, it wasn't plague.
6192355001827321 
6192355001827322 
6192355001827323 Behind the locked doors of one house in the Dusk district, one can hear footsteps.
6192355001827324 I've found infected people.
6192355001827325 The town is doomed. My search was pointless.
6192355001827326 
6192355001827327 
6192355001827328 I've found the infected people… but what does it matter? The Stone Yard is doomed. Was searching for the carrier even my true mission here…?
6192355001827329 
6192355001827330 
6192355001827331 Most orderlies have abandoned the Stone Yard. Few remain on duty.

6192355001827340 I have a heart now. Perhaps the tragedians would like to have a look.
6192355001827341 I misinterpreted the tragedians.

6192355001827349 A suspicious crowd has gathered by one of the houses in the Dusk district.
6192355001827350 The suspicious visitors of a house in the Dusk district claim that they've come to see a dream-teller.
6192355001827451

6192355001829258 
6192355001829259 
6192355001830176 What were you dreaming about anyway? You were screaming as though devils were dragging you to hell by hooks...
6192355001830177 Something like that, actually. Could you remind me where the sick man is?
6192355001830178 I dreamed that the plague has infiltrated this place, the Stone Yard. It talked to me and said, "Here I am. The birds are gathering around the marble nest." Whatever that means...
6192355001830179 Death talked to me. It said I only have time until the evening.
6192355001830180 I see... Were there bulls in your dream?
6192355001830181 ...How do you know?
6192355001830182 Just one. Rather spine-chilling though. Why do you ask?
6192355001830183 Too bad. If you dream of a bull, that means the dream is prophetic. So it'll come true. Everybody knows this omen.\nYou need to see Sahba.
6192355001830184 I don't believe in omens. Now please remind me where I'm supposed to go.
6192355001830185 Well, that probably means a lot of important things are going to happen today. And with your kind help, my "today" started rather early... too early, perhaps.
6192355001830186 You need to go to Blacky—to the left, through the gate. His house will be the one directly in front of you. As for the Crucible, it's on the main square, and that's where the Judge lives. He's probably at home.
6192355001830187 I've been in this town for a week now, I know where the Crucible is. It's hard to miss the main square.
6192355001830188 All right. As for you, stay in!
6192355001830189 Uh huh. Oh, and one more thing... Don't give nuts to Shrew.
6192355001830190 Shrews are the least of my concerns now, lad. Rats, on the other hand...
6192355001830191 Why? I thought rodents liked nuts.
6192355001830192 Because. Just don't.
6192355001830193 I'll consider it.
6192355001830194 You are late. A man died.\nAllow me to draw your attention to the fact that people keep dying because of you. Sometimes I suspect that death is not a foe of yours, but rather a partner.
6192355001830195 ...How did he die?
6192355001830196 Really? What are you doing here then?
6192355001830197 Mind how you're addressing your superior, orderly. State your name, number, and assigned duty.
6192355001830198 I'm just standing my watch.\nCome, little birds, and gather around the marble nest!
6192355001830199 If the body's already been taken away, why are you still here?
6192355001830200 Why do I have to keep reminding you orderlies of what exactly your responsibilities are?
6192355001830201 Ah, so you think I'm an orderly? Yeah, these costumes do have their downsides. Not the best outfits if you want to talk to someone fact to face. The person inside would find it difficult to prove their identity...
6192355001830202 Who are you?
6192355001830203 That doesn't excuse you from being polite. Especially when talking to me. 
6192355001830204 This man died of your negligence.
6192355001830205 What...?
6192355001830206 You're lying.
6192355001830207 Neither pox nor cholera nor sand pest kill people. All they do is reduce their lifetime. Yet the time of the world is yours to control.\nWho was the murderer: a sickness that let no second go to waste—or you, who bothered not to hurry? I think it's the latter.
6192355001830208 Get lost, whoever you are. I don't want to see you ever again.
6192355001830209 It's all right. It's all right. There is still a chance to fix everything.
6192355001830210 Relieved? An ordinary stroke... Yes, not everyone dies of the sand pest.\nOh no, it all begins someplace else. You've got the wrong address.
6192355001830211 Well, perhaps you could tell me the correct one?
6192355001830212 What are you doing here?
6192355001830213 Where is the boy? Where did you come from? ...Report your name, number, and assigned duty. Now.
6192355001830214 Just standing my watch. Birdies, birdies, gather here around the marble nest!
6192355001830215 If you came for the body, where are your assistants?
6192355001830216 Why do I have to keep reminding you orderlies of what exactly your responsibilities are?
6192355001830217 Ah, so you think I'm an orderly? Yeah, these costumes do have their downsides. Not the best outfits if you want to talk to someone fact to face. The person inside would find it difficult to prove their identity...
6192355001830218 Who are you then?
6192355001830219 That doesn't excuse you from being polite. Especially when talking to me. 
6192355001830220 Oh, you thought you could catch me on the first try? That's quite an ego, doctor. Ambition seems to be your middle name.\nYou challenge death—and expect your fight to be this simple? You must be kidding... I'm almost offended.
6192355001830221 I've been fighting death for many years. And I usually succeed.
6192355001830222 Stop following me!
6192355001830239 You are arrogant and condescending, doctor. You despise people. Their life, health, and time mean nothing to you.\nWant an example? You turned the Cathedral into an isolation ward, and now it is chock-full of exhausted and terrified people. They've spent a torturous night there, waiting for you to examine them... yet you're in no hurry to relieve their suffering.
6192355001830240 Everyone who exhibited suspicious signs was brought there. It had to be done.
6192355001830241 God damn it! Slipped my mind completely...
6192355001831074 Who were you talking to just now, doc?
6192355001831075 Is this your idea of a joke?
6192355001831076 You tell me. I couldn't make heads or tails of what you were saying.
6192355001831077 To you. And I've got more to say. I know who you are.
6192355001831078 No, sir. I was ordered to come, sir. A person has died here, sir.\nWe take our orders seriously around here, sir.
6192355001831079 Forget it. Doesn't matter... Just do your job.
6192355001831080 Drop the act. I know it was you.
6192355001831081 I just came in here, doc.
6192355001831082 You're lying.
6192355001831083 Who the hell are you?
6192355001831084 I'm an orderly, doctor. Avrely Gubar, number eleven.\nThese outfits, sir, make it hard to tell which one of us is which, but we're wearing them on your orders, sir... And they do help, thank you kindly. Good protection.
6192355001831085 Well, you're good at changing voice, I'll give you that...
6192355001831086 ...Are you feeling okay, doctor, sir? You're kind of pale, dark rings under the eyes present, too...\nYou must be overworked and exhausted. Your schedule is insane. You need to have a good long sleep, sir. Very long.
6192355001831087 It's all right... I'll have a nice long sleep in the evening.
6192355001831088 You are correct, I am overworked.
6192355001831089 There's no time to rest. I'm planning to examine this whole house. Do you have a master key?
6192355001831093 I do, sir. Here it is, sir. Please kindly note how fragile it is, sir, only good to unlock a couple of doors, three maybe. Then it breaks.
6192355001831094 Better than nothing. Hand it over.
6192355001831095 Take care of the deceased.
6192355001831096 ???
6192355001831097 Orderly No. 11
6192355001832493 
6192355001834551 
6192355001834552 
6192355001834553 
6192355001834554 
6192355001835051 ...Can you hear them?
6192355001835052 What?
6192355001835053 The voices.
6192355001835054 That must be in the mansion.
6192355001835055 No... nothing. Must have been leaves.
6192355001835056 Why did you come here? Your camp is in the steppe, behind the Cathedral.
6192355001835057 I used to live in this house, you know. That's where I stayed when I came to your town a week ago...
6192355001835058 It's too sorrowful there. One of us is getting married. No time for joy.
6192355001835059 I'm sorry.
6192355001835060 Isn't marriage a happy occasion?
6192355001835061 Yes, your people's rituals are monstrous.
6192355001835062 Not according to our traditions.
6192355001835063 It'd be curious to see your funeral then.
6192355001835064 At Eva Yan's, I know. And then she died. Do you know why?
6192355001835065 I do. Because of me.
6192355001835066 Well, she didn't succumb to the sand pest...
6192355001835067 She commited suicide. Jumped from atop your bloody Cathedral.
6192355001835068 You're mistaken. Eva is alive.
6192355001835069 Whatever they say, don't believe them. Whatever it feels like, don't worry.\nYou're alive.
6192355001835070 I know.
6192355001835071 So are you.
6192355001836314 So scary... But... Just... Keep yourself together, all right, doc? The fight is not over, is it?\n...Is it?
6192355001836315 I think it is.
6192355001836316 Of course it isn't. Don't worry.
6192355001836317 You can stay here for as long as you like. The world is your oyster. You can even live forever if you want. As for the banging... and the other horrors... just forget them.
6192355001836318 How can anyone forget all this?
6192355001836319 Just keep it out of your head. Allow yourself to zone out. And morning will come once again. Once again, I will... erm... wake you up, sort of. Will help you, too, like I always do.\nEverything will be fine, like it was before. Eh?
6192355001836320 Sounds tempting, can't argue with that.
6192355001836321 How about shutting it for a second, so as not to break my concentration? That would be of immense help.

6192355001840851 Staff Sergeant Plover. Contrary to the instructions of a representative of the local authorities, Judge Georgiy Kain, I kept my squad on security duty. Your orders, sir?
6192355001840852 Tell me more. What happened?
6192355001840853 Yesterday, the Cathedral was filled to the brim with people who exhibited signs of the sand plague. I hope they're all still inside?
6192355001840854 Where is the Judge?
6192355001840855 Well... There were forty or so potentially infected people inside. Then, yesterday they told us the outbreak had been curbed. No additional protective measures necessary. The locals even went as far as to try and break the people out of the Cathedral, "else they would languish in vain." The judge cancelled the quarantine. Now everyone's gone.
6192355001840856 Why are you still here then?
6192355001840857 Where is the Judge?
6192355001840858 Gone to his place. There, up the stairs; go towards that beakheaded buffoon of yours and you won't miss it.
6192355001840859 In that case, I'll go and have a word with him.
6192355001840860 He's not a buffoon. It's a protective outfit. Anyway, why haven't you left?
6192355001840861 I don't want to be court-martialled. It wasn't the Judge who assigned us here. \n...And it's frightening too, doctor. One can't be too cautious.
6192355001840862 Scared? Of what?
6192355001840863 A couple of them stayed inside. The rest have scattered, but these ones... Must be "mites", plaguebearers. Either dead on their feet or responsible enough not to flee. We haven't checked.
6192355001840864 You don't need to. I'll do it.
6192355001840865 You have my gratitude, Sergeant. It's a relief to see that at least one person still has a head on their shoulders.
6192355001840866 Are you kidding? Gone with the wind.
6192355001840867 Why are you still here then?
6192355001840876 Well, doctor? Is this it?
6192355001840877 I don't think so. But let them stay inside. That's what they want anyway.
6192355001840878 I don't know. I'm not sure. I'd rather not take risks.
6192355001840879 I think it might be.
6192355001840880 Any further orders, sir?
6192355001840881 Lock up the Cathedral from the outside. Then you may go.
6192355001840882 At ease. Do whatever you want.
6192355001840883 Stay here and keep an eye on these two. The threat is real.
6192355001840884 So, that's it, right? ...We're free to go?
6192355001840885 Why are there so few of you? Where are the rest of the guards? I left two platoons here!
6192355001840886 Are you the commanding officer?
6192355001840887 What's going on?
6192355001840888 I mean, the Cathedral's been opened again, so... Everyone's gone. Ours is the only unit left. Plover is a beast when it comes to discipline and orders.
6192355001840889 Inside, there were three dozens of people whose symptoms resembled those of the sand plague! What's going on...?
6192355001840890 Unlocked? By whom?
6192355001840891 Look over there, by the entrance, see? That's Staff Sergeant Plover. Ask him. He's the one who talked to the people in charge.
6192355001840892 ...
6192355001840893 Until the outbreak has been curbed, I'm the person in charge!
6192355001840894 I mean, they say the threat is no more... only across the river, but the plague is dying out there too. We managed a counterattack on it, didn't we?
6192355001840895 What counterattack, soldier? Infection isn't human, you can't shoot it!
6192355001840896 ...At ease.
6192355001840897 We're guarding them "wicks." As per your orders. The moment anyone so much as sneezes, they're dragged here.\nOver the last three days, all kinds of people were run to earth and brought here... Today, all of them were let go.
6192355001840898 What do you mean, "let go"? By whom?
6192355001840900 I know I'm sick. So I'm going to surrender myself to the soldiers. Let them execute me.\nIt's as simple as leaving the Cathedral, you know.
6192355001840901 Is that so? Well, why are you still here then?
6192355001840902 How long have you been here?
6192355001840903 Extend your arm please, I'd like to check the pulse. And look me in the eye.
6192355001840904 Your stubbornness will be your undoing... and your main regret. You'll find yourself in our shoes sooner than you think.
6192355001840905 My shoes are not that comfortable either. Not the type to get jealous about.
6192355001840906 Right. I'll be sure to remember your keen warning.
6192355001840907 Dora over there holds me back. Talk to her, doctor. Examine her and if she's fine—let her go.
6192355001840908 And if she's not...?
6192355001840909 So you want the easy way out, huh? Dying is easy. Living is hard and painful.
6192355001840910 Then the bullet is, once again, preferable. Faster, anyway. I've seen the victims of the sand plague.\nIf she has already contracted it, just help me convince her that she must walk out of this place and face death with an unwavering heart. She'll take your word.
6192355001840911 Aren't you afraid of death?
6192355001840912 Stop it.
6192355001840913 You have to be a moron to not be afraid of death. But death at least promises some semblance of hope. Here, no hope is fathomable.\nI don't want to spend my time imprisoned in this stone sack. Firstly, it's boring. Secondly, it hurts. I'm feverish.
6192355001840914 Isn't it the other way round? Dum spiro spero. While you're alive, there is still hope, yet death is final.
6192355001840915 ...And delirious. You are indeed in a bad condition. Let us begin with the examination.
6192355001840916 Take a look around. This isn't life.
6192355001840917 Let's get this discussion over with and move on to the examination. Please extend your arm.
6192355001840918 [The symptoms do remind you of the sand plague: fever, dilated pupils, slurred speech patterns. He will not live to see this evening. But a person sick with sand plague at this stage would also have yellowish skin coloration. It's hard to say for sure.]
6192355001840919 I'm sorry, but I can't just let you die. If you're infected, I need to keep you here as proof that I'm right about the new outbreak. I'm locking you in.
6192355001840920 ...Say what you will, but it's not the sand pest. I'd say euthanasia by soldiers' bullets is inadvisable in your case. You will be escorted to my place. I'll take another look at you in the evening.
6192355001840921 I'm not going anywhere without her.
6192355001840922 Touching. In that case, wait here. I'll examine your friend.
6192355001840923 Sure, the two of you may go. I don't need to examine her, the case is clear.\nThis isn't it...
6192355001840924 Go with her then. Your friend is fine.
6192355001840925 Your choice. That means the both of you are staying.
6192355001840926 Dora wouldn't leave without me. You have to find a way to trick her. Tell her I'm okay.\nShe doesn't belong here.
6192355001840927 ...To hell with you two. Get lost, both of you.\nI hope I won't come to regret this decision.
6192355001840928 Her choice. That means you both are staying.
6192355001840929 To hell with me—but have pity on her! She wouldn't go without me!
6192355001840930 ...All right. Get lost. I really hope this will serve as a good reference when I pass to kingdom come.
6192355001840931 No. This is my final answer.
6192355001840932 For all eternity, it feels. I'm tired of this torture. I'd prefer death. I want out.
6192355001840933 Go then, what are you waiting for?
6192355001840934 ...You'd prefer death? Seriously?
6192355001840935 Get a grip! Now is not the time to be afraid.
6192355001840936 I'm not afraid.
6192355001840937 You be the change you want to see in the world.
6192355001840938 You are a doctor. Your job is to preserve people's lives. You hear me? You—are—life!\nWhile you're with us, there is still hope. For as long as you live, so do we!
6192355001840939 I know. Shut your face.
6192355001840940 Your logic is very much flawed, but I got the gist.
6192355001840941 So now you're fervently clinging to life? That's quite a vivid contrast... you looked way more dignified back in the Cathedral.
6192355001840942 You're back. So it's true? That you're losing your grip and giving up?
6192355001840943 Why, you seem to have abandoned your suicidal fantasies! Looking good and oddly healthy, my mate.
6192355001840944 Well, my hands get awfully tired, what with them being constantly raised up in the air, so forgive me if my grip is a bit slack.
6192355001840945 Spare me your sense of humor, Bachelor. You didn't answer my question. Are you throwing in the towel?\nOr perhaps a more flattering wording will do it. Did you choose to surrender?
6192355001840946 Who told you this nonsense?
6192355001840947 No. I'm prepared to fight to the end.
6192355001840948 It's not a surrender... but rather a triumph of common sense.
6192355001840949 That orderly, an assistant of yours.
6192355001840950 I wonder what he meant.
6192355001841351 It wasn't an orderly.
6192355001841951 Don't listen to him, he's raving. Thinks he's got sand pest. But I know perfectly well it's mere consumption...
6192355001841952 Is that so? I didn't know you were a doctor too. Any suggestions in terms of treatment, dear colleague?
6192355001841953 And you are his... who?
6192355001841954 I'd rather examine you. Your arm, if you please... and look at the light.
6192355001841955 Outside spells death. Yet in here, we can live on.
6192355001841956 ...For a while.
6192355001841957 I'd rather say outside spells a significant degree of uncertainty.
6192355001841958 ...Sister. Of a sort. Why should you care? How is it important?
6192355001841959 What is important then?
6192355001841960 Indeed. I'd rather examine your own condition. Look at the light, please, and don't inhale too deeply.
6192355001841961 For as long as we're here, we remain alive. This is what matters. Just... just leave us be, I suppose. Lock us in, if that's what safety demands. All I want is to stay with him some more.
6192355001841962 ...And now let me feel your forehead, please.
6192355001841963 Your friend doesn't seem to share your views.
6192355001841964 [She's unnaturally pale and drowning in sweat, but you see no other signs of the sand plague. The vacant look and generally unfocussed appearance betray a commotion of the nerves that surpasses general anxiety.]
6192355001841965 I see no obvious signs of infection. But have it your way—I'd rather you stayed here. That would be for the better.
6192355001841966 I don't know... Hard to say for sure. Whatever, you may go.
6192355001841967 For the better indeed. For both of us.
6192355001841968 The Cathedral is going to be locked. Farewell.
6192355001841969 ...But not for me. I do have a conscience, after all. On second thought, I suppose it would be better to relocate you two to my place to keep an eye on you.
6192355001841970 Don't! Leaving this place spells doom...
6192355001841971 What makes you so sure anyway? Perhaps it doesn't. You two will go to my place and stay supervised. End of story.
6192355001841972 What makes you say that? Your chances don't look that bad. As for your friend, give me a moment to examine him...
6192355001841973 No. You are going to my place. The Neck district, 3, if I recall correctly. The best chance you two have is under my supervision.
6192355001841974 For your friend. But not for you.
6192355001841975 For everyone. You, too. And the poor souls that have abandoned this place!
6192355001841976 Well, suit yourself then. You two are free to stay here if you want.
6192355001841977 That's a fair point... Well. You know what? I'd like you two to go to my place and stay there. I want to reexamine you in the evening.
6192355001841978 He's raving. He has a fever.
6192355001841979 I know. Now I'd like to examine you, please.
6192355001841980 If he stays here, he won't make it to the evening.
6192355001841981 He will. For as long as we're here, there is no death.
6192355001841982 "Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not..." That's quite enough. Extend your hand, please.
6192355001841983 It's all right. I'll just pay it no heed. It's just a transition, right? And transitions are always uncomfortable and arduous.\nBut it's all right. See, doctor? I'm not afraid. I keep on working. Am I doing good...?
6192355001841984 Working? What are you talking about?
6192355001841985 Yes, Dora, you're doing very good. I'm proud of you.
6192355001841986 You are a very brave girl. I can't say the same for myself. Forget it all and prepare to die. I think this is it.
6192355001841987 I'm tending to the sick. They're so scared, so hungry for consolation...
6192355001841988 I can see you're counting me among them. Thank you kindly.
6192355001841989 All right. Keep on working. Not for their sake, but for your own.
6192355001841990 You are a very kind girl, Dora. I can't say the same for myself. Forget it all and prepare to die. I think this is it.
6192355001841991 I'm so happy we left the Cathedral behind. Thank you, doctor.\nIf not for you, I'd never take such risk. And I wouldn't let my brother do it too.
6192355001841992 Your condition has plainly improved... which is odd. I was certain you wouldn't make it until the evening. What happened?
6192355001841993 I'm happy for you too. The Cathedral gave me the impression of a rather dull and desolate place.
6192355001841994 I'd call it neither dull nor desolate—there's much more to it than meets the eye. But this place is even more fascinating.
6192355001841995 Yeah... never a dull moment in these parts.
6192355001841996 Really? As for me, I'd skip this town at the earliest opportunity... but the railway station was closed as soon as the epidemic broke out.
6192355001841997 I feel so strange. I have new eyes now; new hands. I want to live! I want to work. To be helpful.
6192355001841998 Lovely. In that case, you could see to the visitors of this place. People come here from time to time... and soon there'll be more of them.
6192355001841999 Strange indeed. I'd examine you more thoroughly if I had the time.
6192355001842000 Well, perhaps this miraculous Cathedral of yours wasn't preserving your lives, but rather doing the opposite? Have you considered that?

6192355001843762 Young crops will rise soon. Stone flowers.
6192355001843763 You are a creature of the steppe. Your camp is back behind the Cathedral. Go back to your lot...
6192355001843764 You're a herb gatherer, aren't you? You odonghs have a special way with grass and herbs, I know that. Are you expecting a ripe harvest here?
6192355001843765 Special harvest. Marble flowers. Granite flowers.\nEarth is breathing. Ripe harvest on its way.
6192355001843766 Don't you have enough herbs in the steppe? Go back where you belong.
6192355001843767 If anyone sees you, there's bound to be trouble. As far as I know, the locals aren't too fond of your kind.
6192355001843768 The air is changing. Hear it. The smell is changing. Touch it.\nSomething bad is brewing. Right here. 
6192355001843769 Do you feel something odd? What is it?
6192355001843770 Are you by any chance... out of it? Delirious, perhaps? I can't make out what you're saying.
6192355001843771 Look closely. Listen closely. Where are the flies flying? Where are the rats rattling?\nWhere is new life germinating? Soon, it begins.
6192355001843772 I hate fearmongers, you know.
6192355001843773 Then take your stone grass with you and get lost.

6192355001845353 
6192355001845354 
6192355001845355 Hello, doctor. What did you dream of today?
6192355001845356 I don't believe in dream-telling. What I do believe is that your place is across the river. You have five minutes to pack your belongings.
6192355001845357 Who are you?
6192355001845358 I dreamed... I dreamed that an outbreak would happen here today. The plague itself came to me wearing an orderly's outfit and gave me time until the evening... No matter. It sounds stupid when I say it out loud.
6192355001845359 Why, doctor? What have I done to you? I thought all the healthy people belonged here, to this part of the town. And yet you would banish me from this ark...
6192355001845360 There are alarming rumors circulating, and they have to do with you. People claim that you supposedly can cure the sand plague.
6192355001845361 If the desperate infected people find out you're here, they'll storm the place... and succeed.
6192355001845362 If you can truly cure the sand plague, you'll manage.
6192355001845363 You wouldn't even say hello, huh... I'm Sahba. The townsfolk like you call me Aspity. My real, steppe name is Sahba-ötün, but it's hard to pronounce. I am a souvilag'sh by trade. Meaning... "the one who teaches how to walk". It's untranslatable to your language.
6192355001845364 Nope, very much translatable. So what is a teacher like you doing here?
6192355001845365 I'm not one of the townsfolk. I'm an outsider.
6192355001845366 I need a dreamhook. Try to remember the mood, if only for a second. This is crucial.\nThen, in your mind's eye, imagine a single detail that seemed pivotal to you. Just don't try to invent anything new; remember it. Then I'll be able to see your dream as if it was mine.
6192355001845367 I confronted death... like I always do. It asked me if I was ready to die.
6192355001845368 I remember you! You were there, in my dream, telling me I failed to understand something.
6192355001845369 The sand plague infiltrated the Stone Yard. Looked very realistic, too...
6192355001845370 Stop playing games with me! Pack up your things and leave. This whole steppe mysticism shtick is getting on my nerves.
6192355001845371 You're missing the point, doctor. And I think you also tend to mix up death and plague, which are actually not the same. You mix up death, death, and death. But they are not the same. You can't even tell death from death. Not the same. How many different words did I use?
6192355001845372 Forty-something, all of them meaningless.
6192355001845373 One. Are you telling me they sounded different to you?
6192355001845374 The thing that came to you tonight was death—not death, as you thought. It wants you to understand why it haunts you, and it won't take you in until you do. It's as simple as that.
6192355001845375 I see. So was I supposed to just accept everything and meekly go belly up?
6192355001845376 No. If you agree to die without understanding, you will simply cease to exist.\nI doubt that that would be of interest to you... and it'd definitely be pointless to your visitor. And it would never do anything unless it has a point.
6192355001845377 Death literally is the cessation of existence. I've been studying it all my life. I know what I'm talking about.
6192355001845378 ...This is precisely why it can't just take you in. You're blind; you don't know the first thing about it. Death is not the end... not at all.\nWould you like me to prove it to you? You're a doctor, you'd easily see through any act. Watch me die properly. When it knocks, simply open the door.
6192355001845379 All right, let's take a look at your proof.
6192355001845380 Why would I be convinced by your gimmicks? It's not like you have a degree.
6192355001845381 Like hell I will. Find yourself someone more gullible.
6192355001845382 Because I know how to die properly. Do you have a weapon?
6192355001845383 No, I don't.
6192355001845384 Yes, it's called intelligence. And now it's telling me that you're spewing nonsense. End of story.
6192355001845385 Fine. Let's see your proof.
6192355001845386 Not true. I simply know how to die properly. This made people think I'm immortal... which I'm not. Then they began gossiping about how I can't get infected, how I'm invulnerable... which I'm, once again, not. Then they invented some kind of non-existent cure... This is all nonsense.
6192355001845387 That doesn't change the fact that your presence jeopardizes the district. The last thing I need is for insane plaguebearers to gather here.
6192355001845388 Actually, I came here because I was waiting for you. I can leave, fine. But don't you have a very unpleasant appointment scheduled for today's evening? Are you sure you're prepared for it?
6192355001845389 How do you know? Can you read minds or something?
6192355001845390 Yes I am. Now off with you.
6192355001845391 See? There's nothing terrible about it. I died properly.
6192355001845392 Hm... Care to do an encore? Slowly, please.
6192355001845393 What do you mean, properly?
6192355001845394 ...This is a rather torturous experience, Bachelor. Very much so, to be honest.
6192355001845395 So why did you do it then?
6192355001845396 I knew why it needed to happen. Never let this understanding slip my mind, not even for a second.\n...Of course, concentrating and the ability to clear your mind of any secondary thoughts are crucial. That's all there's to it.
6192355001845397 And why did it need to happen?
6192355001845398 This time I did it because I needed to convince you that running away from death will get you nowhere. You won't win this way, you'll only make it worse.
6192355001845399 How is it worse if death is painful? What's wrong with postponing the experience?
6192355001845400 It makes you gradually more and more frightened. It won't help you understand how to die properly. You will still die in the end... with fits and starts.\nAnd that, Bachelor, will be your true, absolute end. You will simply cease to be. It's not quite as unpleasant as eternal damnation, but still rather less than thrilling.
6192355001845401 All right. I need to think this whole situation over.
6192355001845402 No, I still don't believe you. This is all some kind of trick. I've seen the performance of a world-class magician in the capital, his spiel was roughly the same.
6192355001845403 "Drop your weapon, stop the resistance, unlock the gate, and we will spare your lives." The oldest trick in the book, yet it never fails.
6192355001845404 You are far from cowardly, doctor. But your mulishness rivals that of a bull. Your head is stuffed with science; your eyes, sewn shut.\nYou will walk this path time and again, until every last bit of your resolve wears off. And who needs you without it?
6192355001845405 I don't like being manipulated. Your sermons fell on deaf ears here.
6192355001845406 Who is behind that door?
6192355001845407 Death, obviously.
6192355001845408 It's nice to see that it's so well-mannered as to knock.
6192355001845409 Well, luckily for us, it's still locked out. As for you, your place is across the river.
6192355001845410 Good job, scientist. You did it. Was it hard to cope with fear?
6192355001845411 Fear? Surely you wanted to say "curiosity"? A bit, yes.
6192355001845412 Not in the slightest.
6192355001845413 Stop showing off. You've a master at giving the creeps, I admit.
6192355001845414 What about thoughts?
6192355001845415 Not thinking about a polar bear? You can imagine how well that went.
6192355001845416 I like neither overactive imaginations nor superstitions, scientist. I like facts. Here's one: the thing that was behind your back is not standing there anymore. You're free. You've won.
6192355001845417 ...What do you mean?
6192355001845418 I don't believe you. It was an impressive miracle-play, granted, but how can you call me a winner when the outbreak across the river has not gone anywhere?
6192355001845419 Easily. Watch me: you're a winner. Any moron can save lives, and everyone wants to. Refusing to open the door to an enemy though... so fierce, so alluring, so personal, made just for you!\nStop arguing, scientist. You've won.
6192355001845420 Arguing with you is more trouble than it's worth. Please allow the winner to indulge in the lowly pleasure of saving lives. You said you know someone who's not affected by the sand pest...?
6192355001845421 Any chance I've become immune to the disease now, like those... how'd-you-call-thems of yours?
6192355001845422 My faithful are immune to the disease. I can bring one to your place if you want. You'll have a look at him. The winner is allowed to...
6192355001845423 The things I do for science.
6192355001845424 Please bring me one, yes.
6192355001845425 Yes, Sahba. Please bring me one.
6192355001845426 Yes, Aspity. Please bring me one.
6192355001845427 The thing that was behind your back is not standing there anymore.\nYou were its only purpose, after all. You were the one longing so badly for an unbeatable for to fight. So it came, but—in a twist—you didn't open. Offended, it went away...
6192355001845428 Ha ha. Very bloody funny.
6192355001845429 Don't you ever say that again. Not even as a joke. The mere thought of me being "the only purpose" of the whole outbreak, of the town perishing...
6192355001845430 ...You are far from cowardly, doctor. Mulish though. Your head is stuffed with science; your eyes, sewn shut.\nYou will walk this path time and again, until every last bit of your resolve wears off. And who are you without it? Who would need you?
6192355001845431 I don't like being manipulated. Your sermons fell on deaf ears here.
6192355001845432 Who is behind that door?
6192355001845433 Death, obviously.
6192355001845434 It's nice to see that it's so well-mannered as to knock.
6192355001845435 Well, luckily for us, it's still locked out. As for you, your place is across the river.
6192355001845436 
6192355001845437 See? There's nothing terrible about it. I died properly.
6192355001845438 Hm... Care to do an encore? Slowly, please.
6192355001845439 What do you mean, properly?
6192355001845440 ...This is a rather torturous experience, Bachelor. Very much so, to be honest.
6192355001845441 So why did you do it then?
6192355001845442 I knew why it needed to happen. Never let this understanding slip my mind, not even for a second.\nConcentration and the ability to clear your mind of any secondary thoughts are crucial. That's all there's to it.
6192355001845443 And why did it need to happen?
6192355001845444 This time I did it because I needed to convince you that running away from death will get you nowhere. You won't win this way, you'll only make it worse.\n...There's no need to hurry, though. Suicide only leads to void. It's not the right way to cross the threshold.
6192355001845445 How can it be worse? And if death is so painful, why hurry?
6192355001845446 Because there is fear swelling inside you. And fear won't help you understand how to die properly.\nEven without the understanding, you will still die, Bachelor, but it won't be a true death. To the contrary; it will be your complete, absolute end. You will simply cease to be. It's not quite as unpleasant as eternal damnation, but still rather less than thrilling.
6192355001845447 All right. I need to mull this whole situation over.
6192355001845448 No, I still don't believe you. This is all some kind of trick. I've seen the performance of a world-class magician in the Capital, his spiel was roughly the same.
6192355001845449 "Drop your weapons, stop resisting, unlock the gate, and we will spare your lives." The oldest trick in the book, yet it never fails.

6192355001853663 …As for the relationship with nature, we are rebelling against it! No wonder it pushes back. The steppe people live as though they're in a primeval time reverse, like stone axes have yet to be invented. Worshipping bulls! Talking to herbs! They don't even have a real language, it's all <i>bol bol</i> this and <i>gur gur</i> that! And yet for some reason, we allow them here.
6192355001853664 And what's wrong with that? There are many peoples on earth untouched by civilization.
6192355001853665 But they do have a language, and a rather beautiful one at that.
6192355001853666 What about the sacrifices? I'll have you know they still make those. It's simply wrong to entangle different ages within the same space, is all! Their age is <i>different.</i> Our time is broken! It's crippled, Bachelor! They've come from the past. So release them, let them return to the earth they hold so dear. Let them leave.
6192355001853667 Is someone holding them here?
6192355001853668 Make sacrifices? You're exaggerating, pal. I find it hard to believe.
6192355001853669 Oh yes, the sacrifices. Please send a soldier squadron to the camp behind the Cathedral. I want it burnt to ashes.
6192355001853670 Sacrifices… This is a nuptial ceremony of theirs. And they have a point…
6192355001853671 Someone is… our rulers. They have embedded the steppe people into this town, carved them into its warm flesh. This isn't a town, it's an honest-to-God minotaur. A chimera. And chimeras have remarkably short lifespans and bad health. Can you breed a snake and a crane? You can, yes. But the progeny won't live long.
6192355001853672 A chimera, huh? You make a good point.
6192355001853673 …You have no idea how far interbreeding can go. I know a thing or two about living organisms, so take my word for it.
6192355001853674 Have you ever seen a mule?
6192355001853675 This is an impossible town, Bachelor! You just can't have your cake and eat it. Can't mix oil and water. Can't connect similarly-charged magnet poles… or rather you can, but only by force. And as soon as that force falters, it's all going to be shredded to pieces. We are abusing nature!
6192355001853676 You need a sociologist, not a medical scientist. I'm not sure if biological principles are applicable here.
6192355001853677 If not for the rebellion against nature, we still wouldn't be able to use fire.
6192355001853678 Doctor, would you mind settling an argument of ours? You are, after all, an outsider in this town, with a clear head and a fresh outlook. We've been arguing over the reasons for the sand plague outbreak. You would, of course, agree that it happened in this particular town for a reason, wouldn't you?
6192355001853679 Indeed. I don't believe in random chance.
6192355001853680 It could have happened anywhere.
6192355001853681 Exactly, Bachelor. Not a single alarm. Nothing suspicious. All thanks to your iron will and the strict measures you enforced. The disease has remained across the river. Here, it's all clear. Anyone who felt weak or unwell was led to the Cathedral, but it's obvious that none of them were infected. So, will you settle our argument…?
6192355001853682 All right, I'm all ears.
6192355001853683 I couldn't care less for your arguments. Get back to work!
6192355001853684 As a matter of fact, this town is nothing but a machine… produced to challenge the limits of human potential. And our ideas of how people connect to each other. Our very relationship with nature. For more than a century, the three families ruling us have been running such experiments on the local population. You've found yourself in a utopia.
6192355001853685 Death is a limit, unjustly imposed upon men. Humanity has long outgrown it. So what exactly were you arguing about?
6192355001853686 Don't you have better things to do? Your job is to keep tabs on anything alarming! Don't tell me nothing suspicious happened overnight!
6192355001853687 I believe otherwise. Get yourself together, people! Mobilize all forces!
6192355001853688 We're at your service, Bachelor.
6192355001853689 Open the shop. It's been quarantined long enough. There's no danger in selling groats and grain.
6192355001853690 Find a way to pacify the rabblerousers rioting by the shop. And do not, under any circumstances, open it!
6192355001853691 We need to set up a spare hospital in any ordinary house. Arrange for beds and other necessary equipment to be delivered there. You know the drill.
6192355001853692 Stay vigilant.
6192355001853693 Your word is our command.
6192355001853694 All right. Oh, and you mentioned an argument you were having…?
6192355001853695 Good. As for you, stay here, and stay alert.
6192355001853696 Have you been keeping watch all night long? Let someone else take the next shift.
6192355001853697 Really, Doctor…? You must be overworked. What for? The Stone Yard is clear. We should know.\nAnd in any case, it's not possible. All residential houses are overcrowded with healthy refugees from across the river.
6192355001853698 God damn you! How about the place that I'm staying at, then? It's otherwise vacant.
6192355001853699 Shame. In that case, keep using the Cathedral for these purposes. It's not like it has other uses around here.
6192355001853700 I think it's all because of the Polyhedron. That gravity-defying tower the children play in.
6192355001853701 To this day, I'm confused how it's supported… Balanced, somehow? I'm not much of an engineer.
6192355001853702 They say your children founded a republic inside. Why do your hate your own youth so much?
6192355001853703 An impressive attempt to defy the law of gravity.
6192355001853704 Doctor, would you mind settling an argument of ours? You are, after all, an outsider in this town, with a clear head and a fresh outlook. We've been arguing over the reasons for the sand plague outbreak. You would, of course, agree that it happened in this particular town for a reason, wouldn't you?

6192355001853720 God damn you! How about the place that I'm staying at, then? It's otherwise vacant.

6192355001853722 As a matter of fact, this town is nothing but a machine… produced to challenge the limits of human potential. And our ideas of how people connect to each other.

6192355001853725 I have found myself in hell. Get yourself together, people! Mobilize all forces!
6192355001853726 History already knows an example of people trying to erect an impossible tower. It ended in tragedy.
6192355001853727 It's not history. It's myth.
6192355001853728 However, your edifice looks complete.
6192355001853729 Do you believe in God, Bachelor?
6192355001853730 What an unexpected twist of the conversation! Do you believe the epidemic to be a punishment from God?
6192355001853731 No, I don't.
6192355001853732 It may come as a surprise to you, but I do.
6192355001853733 There's only one thing I'm certain of. If this was an ordinary, common-as-blackberries town, there'd be no outbreak. Or it'd have been something equally common and ordinary, like cholera or pox.
6192355001853734 You may well be right. Scientifically, this is called the "butterfly effect."
6192355001853735 <i>Post hoc non propter hoc.</i> Don't mix correlation and causation.
6192355001853736 As for me, Doctor, I'd say it's simple. Men must not be remodeled or altered, even if they request it themselves. Pitied, yes, but not altered. What's wrong with men, anyway? We have so little time on this earth that it's barely possible to scratch the surface of what we are, let alone explore humanity fully. Man is infinite.
6192355001853737 To the contrary, man is far too finite.
6192355001853738 Exactly. We have too little time. Which is exactly why we should fight death.
6192355001853739 But what does it have to do with the epidemic?
6192355001853740 I don't know. I only feel that this is the root of the problem. It wasn't we who designed the world like this. I believe in men, Doctor; in superhumans, I do not. This earthly life wouldn't fit them. Immortals have no place in the world of the living. This is just how it works. Take from it what you will.
6192355001853741 That's some fervor.
6192355001853742 Well, it's not as absurd a line of thinking as it seems at first glance...
6192355001853743 Doctor, would you mind settling an argument of ours? You are, after all, an outsider in this town, with a clear head and a fresh outlook. We've been arguing over the reasons for the sand plague outbreak. You would, of course, agree that it happened in this particular town for a reason, wouldn't you?
6192355001853744 Indeed. I don't believe in random chance.

6192355001853865 We would kindly suggest that any unauthorized attendants move along, please! Sorry, but our workload is tremendous.
6192355001853866 …Who are you?
6192355001853867 Sorry. Didn't mean to bother you.
6192355001853868 We're here to replace the deceased. Keep tabs on the deceased. Find accomodations for the deceased. Take complaints from the deceased. If you'd like to file a complaint, please wait in line for your turn.
6192355001853869 I think I'm going insane…
6192355001853870 Like hell I'll wait in line!
6192355001853871 Thank heavens, I'm still alive. And I have no intention of dying.
6192355001853872 Every order and instruction of yours has been carried out with precision. We accept no complaints in regards to ourselves or our predecessors, not from you. If you feel dissatisfied with anything, you have no one to blame but yourself.
6192355001853873 Indeed.
6192355001853874 Well, it's good that you've reopened the shop. Their stock is very decent. I only wanted to thank you, is all.
6192355001853875 The beds you've provided for the makeshift hospital are creaky. This will not do. I need to have a good night's sleep.
6192355001854251 That was the carrier. Sure was...
6192355001854252 What makes you think so?
6192355001854253 Who did this?
6192355001854254 Ain't it obvious? A shame we got him so late...!\nWhat were you thinking, doc? How'dya miss him?
6192355001854255 You will pay for this.
6192355001854256 I can't believe it...
6192355001854257 Them savages are the root of all evil. Who else could bring the pest with 'em? Plain as day, it is.
6192355001854258 You imbeciles. He had nothing to do with it.
6192355001854259 Don't you have enough sins to atone for already? Did you really need one more? It's not like you've got much time left. Get lost and go home.
6192355001854260 Good riddance to the plague-bearer... He did it. He brought the pest. There's no one else that could.\nShould burn their steppe den down too... Gather the good people at night, light us some torches and burn it to hell and back!
6192355001854261 What?
6192355001854262 You won't live to see the night. Trust me, I'm a doctor.
6192355001854263 For real! Shouldn't have let them in here in the first place. That was your doing! We know everything.\nYou deserve no better, Worm-lover!
6192355001854264 Well, all men are mortal.
6192355001854265 Calm down. And get lost. Or else...
6192355001854278 
6192355001854279 
6192355001854280 
6192355001854281 
6192355001854282 
6192355001854290 See? Totes waiting here! And you doubted me, too! Here, your share, take it. Fair and square, share and share alike. Half to you, half to me.
6192355001854291 ...This isn't even close to a half!
6192355001854292 I'm impressed—I wasn't expecting to see you here at all. Are your parents alive?
6192355001854293 Here. Your share, fair and square. There was also a bottle of some sort of "pana serum", got smashed.
6192355001854294 Damn you! ...Do you have any idea what a "panacea" is? That bottle was worth more than your weight in diamonds!
6192355001854295 Oh no... You little lying rat... Give it here, now!
6192355001854315 Dunno what you're talking about. I did my best to divide by two.
6192355001854316 Which makes you an incredibly lousy arithmetician. You belong to a school, boy, not to the street, burgling drugstores. 
6192355001854317 Should have foreseen this...
6192355001854318 Nope, orphaned. Hey, will you take me in?
6192355001854319 I'll think about it.
6192355001854320 Like I need you... go bother Burakh.
6192355001854321 I'm not lying, I swear! Here are the pieces, look!
6192355001854322 ...Indeed.
6192355001854323 Well, perhaps there's more at the store...? Go ahead, I'll wait.
6192355001854324 Get lost. Now.
6192355001854325 It was a serum that could cure the sand pest. Enough for several lives, perhaps. Unique, too. There's no one left to make more...
6192355001855251 
6192355001855852 
6192355001856151 Well...? What are you waiting for? C'mon, I ain't got all day!
6192355001856152 I won't have you hurry me up, you shameless little...!
6192355001856153 You keep standing there. Patience builds character.
6192355001866155 
6192355001866156 
6192355001866157 
6192355001866158 
6192355001866159 
6192355001866160 
6192355001866161 
6192355001866162 
6192355001866916 ...I have a very important thing to ask of you.\nDon't listen to Shrew, okay? And never ever give her nuts. It's all a trap. Got it?
6192355001866917 I most certainly didn't.
6192355001866918 Why? I thought rodents like nuts.
6192355001866919 ...Right. What are you lot doing here?
6192355001866920 How's Blacky?
6192355001866921 He's fine. But his stepfather died.
6192355001866922 Were you the person who sent the orderly to his flat?
6192355001866923 Of course not.
6192355001866924 Thought so.
6192355001866925 Speaking of orderlies—one of them reported you lot making yourself busy with something rather shady. I'm looking forward to hearing you explain yourselves.
6192355001866926 Shrew wants you to die. Don't give her anything.
6192355001866927 Shrew? You mean the pig-tails girl? Have I wronged her somehow?
6192355001866928 Not at all. She just thinks your whole ordeal is wrong—and feels sorry for you. Thing is, I don't want you to die.\nYou know what? If you find any nuts, bring them to me instead. I'll give you anything in exchange! How about bandages? You're a doctor, you probably need those.
6192355001866929 What's up with this nut obsession of yours! If you're hungry, how about some bread?
6192355001866930 Bandages? Why do you even have them? In any case, wouldn't it be responsible of you to just give them to me? Without the nut fee?
6192355001866931 They're not food! They're for the dead! Look there—why do you think Sleepy Head is standing by the windows with pocketfuls of nuts?
6192355001866932 Exactly. Why is he?
6192355001866933 Sleepy Head over there is is waiting for the departing to depart. Soon they will. It's a game of ours.
6192355001866934 "The departing"? You mean someone's dying inside...?
6192355001866935 You kids play peculiar games...
6192355001866936 A couple of good masters used to live here, fine-tuners. Sleepy Head wants them to advise him after they die. Nuts can preserve people after death. So Shrew wanted to scrounge one from Sleepy Head for you, but he won't give her any.
6192355001866937 For me?
6192355001866938 I'd like to have a word with your peers now...
6192355001866939 Look, just don't give nuts to Shrew, all right? Give them to me instead. I don't want you to die. You can keep living with us. Teach me, too... I want to be a doctor, y'know.
6192355001866940 If you want to be a doctor, start by removing this ridiculous nonsense you seem to believe in from your head.
6192355001866941 Here. Will this kind of nut do?
6192355001867951 
6192355001867952 
6192355001867953 
6192355001867954 
6192355001868209 Just don't tell Shrew I warned you, 'right? We're good friends, actually...
6192355001868210 As if you warned me of something important. I wouldn't be able to explain your babbling to anyone even if I wanted to...
6192355001868211 Here you go. The nuts.
6192355001868212 The only thing that made sense in your story was that you kids are all starved for nuts.
6192355001868213 Do you have any bandages left? Or other useful supplies? Help me out, my faithful squire.
6192355001868214 Do you really, honestly want to die? Are you bored of us?
6192355001868215 No. I don't intend to die anytime soon.
6192355001868216 Dead bored.
6192355001868217 I see... Tell me, doctor: do you know where you are? Right now, I mean?
6192355001868218 In the unluckiest town on earth.
6192355001868219 Honestly, no idea. Your town is like a maze, and I'm yet to learn to tell the districts apart.
6192355001868220 Yes. I'm at a loss. Should I simply stop giving you attention or should I spice it up with a spanking first?
6192355001868221 You are in your room right now, laying in bed, feverish. Sleepy Head and Shrew are there too. We give you water and put wet towels on your forehead, just like you told us to... It's good that you can at least hear me now. Answer even.
6192355001868222 It's "lying in bed", not "laying", blockhead. When this is all over, you really need to go to school...
6192355001868223 Curious. So are you telling me you didn't wake me up in the morning?
6192355001868224 Over... Yeah, it will be over soon, for you at least. Shouldn't have given Shrew nuts.
6192355001868225 Well, what's done is done. Now let me go. I'm in a hurry,
6192355001868226 You play stupid games...
6192355001868227 I did. But it was yesterday. What time is it now?
6192355001868228 I don't know. I've lost my watch.
6192355001868229 Not the right one for silly banter! Excuse me, I have urgent business to attend to.
6192355001868230 It's almost midnight. You're dying. I didn't want you to die. Even if you're bed-ridden and raving, living is still better than dying... And you know so much interesting stuff, too...
6192355001868231 Very funny. Now please excuse me, I would like to resume my work, if that's fine by you.
6192355001868232 Then keep giving me water and doing the wet towel thing. And thank you for taking good care of me.
6192355001868233 You must feel terrible... right? That's fine. I forgive you.\nYou just got confused... Adults always do.
6192355001868234 Oh yes, adults are always occupied with the most asinine nonsense. Like feeling anxious that a bunch of urchins keep roaming the streets, putting themselves in mortal danger!
6192355001868235 I do feel terrible... for some reason. What I wouldn't give for a gulp of water...
6192355001868236 Yes, doctor. I know you're worried about the sand pest. But we're safe.\nNo, really, we are. So calm down. It's all right.
6192355001868237 Go home. All three of you.
6192355001868238 Not convinced.
6192355001868239 Don't you need lockpicks anymore? Good. I agree that you don't.
6192355001868240 I need to make sure you are all safe. It's called "being responsible." Another boring thing that adults do.
6192355001868241 Oh right, slipped my mind completely... Wait some more then.
6192355001871251 Shrew's got the keys. Not me. I don't need to go in there anyway. One can catch 'em from over here just fine.
6192355001871252 What's in there?
6192355001871253 Catch whom?
6192355001871254 Two solid masters are dying in there right now, Siskin and Lotman. Both have been over the river, so now they're done for. That's what you get for getting carried away! Anyway. I want to collect them into nuts. I'll listen to 'em before I go to sleep 'n they'll advise me.
6192355001871255 So this is what you need nuts for?
6192355001871256 Collect them into nuts? How?
6192355001871257 Let me check if I got everything right. What you're saying is there are two infected persons in that house. Correct?
6192355001871258 I don't need 'em. Got a handful already. It's Shrew who's trying to cajole 'em out of everyone. Well, in my case, fat chance!
6192355001871259 And what does she need them for?
6192355001871260 And who are Siskin and Lotman?
6192355001871261 Nah, they probs just cut 'emselves or something. But you won't get inside anyway. The house is locked.
6192355001871262 Well, how do I unlock it?
6192355001871263 You don't. And I wouldn't tell you if I knew anyway. You'll come back here with 'em beakheads, drag Siskin 'n Lotman to the mortuary, 'n kick me out of here. Right? So how am I going to collect 'em into nuts then? Nah man. You're barking up the wrong tree if you think you can trick me like that.
6192355001871264 Well, I'll find a way in without your help then.
6192355001871265 "Collect them into nuts"? What do you mean?
6192355001871266 A nut is a tricky fruit. It resonates. If you do everything properly, you can preserve a person inside. Got it? Talk to him after death 'n all. Through a teeny tiny hole. If he agrees to, I mean.
6192355001871267 A nut is not a fruit, you blockhead. The rest sounds reasonable though.
6192355001871268 What if he doesn't?
6192355001871269 For you, as far as I know. You're about to kick the bucket too, ain't you? And Shrew likes you. Wants to have you in her collection.
6192355001871270 In her collection? Explain yourself.
6192355001871271 Well, then you wait for him to get bored. It's probably super tiresome sitting inside a nut talking to no one. Eternal life must be tedious.
6192355001871272 Yes... Unless you're evolving.
6192355001871273 Clearly you have a lot of experience in such matters.
6192355001871274 Oooh, they were master hexers! Knew how to hoodwink time into bringing luck. Cast such an awesome spell over my pocket knife that I used to win with it every time! Never cut myself, too. Anyway, they tried a lotta things. Like going 'cross the river... I know that business demanded it, but still. A shame.
6192355001871275 So what, are you waiting for them to peek out of the window?
6192355001871276 I'm waiting for them to die. Don't want their mastery to go to waste.
6192355001871277 What? This makes no sense,
6192355001871278 Just... dontcha worry, 'kay? 'Twill be over soon.
6192355001871279 You three loafers need to go and find yourselves a good safe shelter.
6192355001871280 Impudent little brats, aren't you?
6192355001871281 ...Why is it so hot here?
6192355001871282 Aye, no point arguing with you anyway. We'll come in a sec—just let us finish watching the important part of the action here.
6192355001871283 No "secs"! You're all grounded! I don't need any more bandages or lockpicks—just leave!
6192355001871284 You finish your... whatever it is you're doing—and then get off the street at once. All right?
6192355001872551 Well? Have you collected them?
6192355001872552 Collected what?
6192355001872553 What are you rascals doing here?
6192355001872554 The nuts! You promised to get us nuts.
6192355001872555 ...What do you need nuts for?
6192355001872556 Will candy do?
6192355001872557 "Promised"? When? I've never seen you before.
6192355001872558 How many times have I told you it's none of your business? Must be a hundred times. Or two hundred.\nI need them, simple as that.
6192355001872559 You're mistaking me for someone else, girl.
6192355001872560 Well, I don't. Need this fuss, I mean.
6192355001872561 Doctor, are you sure you're all right? Suppose you've gotten sick yourself?\nThey say the sick ones start to rave and don't recognize their family and can't remember who they are.
6192355001872562 Mind your manners!
6192355001872563 It's just as they say. The first symptom of the sand plague is madness. Strange behaviour. And your behaviour seems very strange to me!
6192355001872564 ...Let me say it again. We had a deal. You can go everywhere, I can't go anywhere, thanks loads for that.\nRight?\nThat's why you get me nuts, and I give you whatever you need in exchange. Like lockpicks. Handmade. Rare. A super luxurious product, if you ask me!
6192355001872565 What I need is for you to stop hanging around with no one overseeing you.
6192355001872566 All right then. Let's honor the deal. I'll try to bring you nuts. Although it feels like the one who's nuts is me...
6192355001872567 Oh, no need to be shy. You can't go anywhere? With a pocketful of rare luxurious handmade lockpicks? Right. Perhaps it would be safer for me to have them.
6192355001872568 Sound like a deal. Here, have a nut.
6192355001872569 No way. And anyway, it's we who are overseeing you. You're dreaming us anyway. Got it?
6192355001872570 Nice try.
6192355001872571 Look, we'll go wherever you want us to go. We'll be good kids. But the nut deal comes first.
6192355001872572 All right. I'll consider it.
6192355001872573 Honestly, I don't need nuts to get you locked up if I decide to. Just like that.
6192355001872574 Well, seems like I have a couple... Lucky you. Or me.
6192355001872575 No! How many times do I have to explain, I'm not going to eat them! They're alive.
6192355001872576 What do you mean, "alive"?
6192355001872577 Those are some right suspicious games you're playing... I don't like that at all.
6192355001872578 I sullenly swear. Heavens, sevens, now and forevance.
6192355001872579 Good.
6192355001872580 When I was your age, the thing to say was "I shall eat earth." But that's unhygienic, so no matter. I trust you.
6192355001872581 Wrong! You need the keys, don't you? The keys to this house, I mean, the one where everybody's dying. But unless you bring me nuts, you'll get no lockpicks! None at all! Got it?
6192355001872582 What? People are dying inside this house? What makes you think so?
6192355001872583 You have lockpicks...? Give them to me. Now. We're dealing with a matter of public safety here.
6192355001872584 Keeping vigil. Waiting for the things inside the house to come to a close. Also for nuts.\nI'll be generous enough to forgive the "rascals" for now. I can even help you get inside. If you bring me a nut, of course.
6192355001872585 ...Why do you need nuts?
6192355001872586 "Come to a close"? What are you talking about...?
6192355001872587 Oh god... It's true what they say: what can you expect from a hog but a grunt? ...All right. Whatever. You've never seen me before. I'll go with that.\nKind uncle doctor, can you get me some nuts, pretty please? I need them so so badly! And, actually, so do you. Even worse than me.
6192355001872588 Are you kids cutting teeth or something?
6192355001872589 I need it worse than you? You don't know what you're saying, young lady.
6192355001872590 I don't want to talk about it. I'm scared. Let Sleepy Head tell you.
6192355001872591 I see... Now hand over the lockpicks. Do it! Or the keys, or what have you.
6192355001872592 You're frightening me.
6192355001872593 Perhaps. But...
6192355001872594 ...Only in exchange for nuts. Got it already. Trading one-for-one, right?
6192355001872595 ...Get better soon, doctor. And I'm so sorry for you.
6192355001872596 I'm fine, thank you. Your whole town, on the other hand, needs help. Direly.
6192355001872597 Here. The nuts. Is this enough?
6192355001872598 Thanks for the concern. Now, about those lockpicks...
6192355001873273 ...Get better soon, doctor. And I'm so sorry for you.
6192355001873274 I'm fine, thank you. Your whole town, on the other hand, needs help. Direly.
6192355001873275 Here. The nuts. Is this enough?
6192355001873276 Thanks for the concern. Now, about those lockpicks...
6192355001873277 So here's how it's gonna be with you, huh! Well, in that case, you're no friend of mine!
6192355001873278 What did I do to lose your favor?
6192355001873279 So when Sticky asks you for nuts, you're all too happy to run his errand and oblige, huh? And I'm second-class?\nDo you even know why he doesn't want me to help you?
6192355001873280 Oh, I didn't realize you wanted to help. In that case, please be so kind as to fetch a bucket of hot water from my place. Chop-chop.
6192355001873281 No, I don't. Why?
6192355001873282 You dummy doctor. Ugh, I can't even look at you. So miserable... Lying in your bed, feverish and unconscious, you honestly still believe you're walking the town. Hot water, you say? Why would you need it hot when one can roast eggs on your forehead anyway!
6192355001873283 What in the world are you talking about?
6192355001873284 ...This is pointless. Look, everyone, here's what a person whose mind was erased by sickness looks like... You are delirious, doctor. Raving. Do you understand? You're sick. Got infected with the sand plague! And so you're hallucinating. It's midnight now, and we're at your place, looking after you!
6192355001873285 I don't feel sick at all.
6192355001873286 Well, I'd say it's you who seems to be raving, girl. And that is a very suspicious symptom. You'll have to come with me.
6192355001873287 Because he doesn't want to let you pass away like normal people do! 'Cause you two are BFFs now or something! He wants to learn stuff from you! And so he clings to you, sticks to you, cures you, and generally plays doctor. Moron. You need to have a pillow stuffed over your face and your soul stuffed into a nut. For safekeeping.
6192355001873288 Seems like it's you who's nuts.
6192355001873289 You clearly have a very kind and compassionate heart. I'll try to make do without the pillow though, all right?
6192355001873290 Pffft, yeah, right. Go with you? Where to? The afterlife? No thank you. You'll have to manage on your own. And since you've failed to bring me a nut, there won't be even a single shred of you staying here. Serves you right, too! You're no friend of mine now.
6192355001873291 Well, in that case, you're no friend of mine either.
6192355001873292 It's not like I don't feel sorry for you. Perhaps I'll even deign to help you after all. But I'll never ever ask you for help again, no sir!
6192355001873293 It's dangerous outside. You should all go home.
6192355001873294 What's important is whether I will help you, not the other way round.
6192355001873295 ...Will you look at this guy, boys? Huh? He still thinks we're all standing somewhere outside!
6192355001873296 Chop-chop.
6192355001873297 I have no intention to play games with you.
6192355001873298 Pfft. All right then. We'll go. And you won't have anyone to barter with anymore.
6192355001873299 I'll live.
6192355001873300 Huh, didn't consider that. Come to think of it, there's no need for you to hurry.
6192355001877151 
6192355001877179 I've already taken heart. Taken a heart, I mean. Undoubtedly, an open one.
6192355001877180 He needs to live. Let him suffer. Just not die today.
6192355001877181 I'll do what I can.
6192355001877182 We'll see.
6192355001877183 Everything will be good now. We are grateful to you.
6192355001877184 How can anyone deal with your people and preserve their sanity?! What happened...?
6192355001877185 Never seen better...
6192355001877186 She was a herb bride. Brides join Earth in wedlock, so that the others may live.\nIt means no one else will die today. You are the doctor. We did this for you.
6192355001877187 You are an insane, barbaric people! How can you live with yourself?!
6192355001877188 So this is what kind of wedding you were celebrating...! Why oh why didn't I listen to the poor wounded guy...
6192355001877189 We fear neither pain nor death. One is immortal while the kin lives.\nYou wouldn't understand.
6192355001877190 Yeah, it's Greek to me...
6192355001877191 If only it was so simple. But I doubt that millions of dying people would agree with you.
6192355001877192 If there'd been mourning, the celebration would have been cancelled. If the celebration had been cancelled, the earth would have gone unfed.\nWhen the earth isn't fed, it feeds itself. And that would be far worse. No one would be saved.
6192355001877193 Are you talking about the plague...? What does it have to do with the earth?
6192355001877194 You don't care about your husband's life at all, do you?
6192355001877195 Well. No one will be saved now...
6192355001877196 You've suffered a great loss. I'm sorry.
6192355001877197 Doctors don't always end up being winners in their duels with death.
6192355001877198 Really? Why?
6192355001877199 Mother Boddho gives us no respite. The earth is calling. Such is our fate then.\nFrom the soil we came, and to the soil we return. As for you, go. We need to prepare ourselves.
6192355001877200 I'm sorry.
6192355001877201 I learned of this place too late.
6192355001878351 You've almost come to. See? We've been here all along.
6192355001878352 What is this banging noise?
6192355001878353 I see, yes. You lot are way too sneaky. Which is why I'll have to lock you in this room—just to be safe.
6192355001878354 What noise? ...Are you okay?
6192355001878355 You lot shouldn't be here...
6192355001878356 Whatever. Now let me through.
6192355001878357 Look y'all, he's waking up... What if he attacks us? I'd say we make a run for it!
6192355001878358 You're running nowhere, I'll make sure of that. You will be locked in and boarded shut... for your own safety.
6192355001878359 I don't think you'd manage to even of you tried, lad. I think we've been boarded in.
6192355001880651 Saturday
6192355001884651 We're not allowed to talk today. There's a celebration.
6192355001884652 ...
6192355001884653 Well... congratulations, I guess.
6192355001892051 Mikhail Goba, orderly No. 2. Awaiting your command, doctor...
6192355001892054 Why did you come?
6192355001892055 Firstly, I need a team of orderlies here, stat. Board off the house. Don't let anyone out... myself included. I'm staying in there. I have likely contracted the disease.

6192355001895174 Everything can change. Would you want it?
6192355001895175 Who are you?
6192355001895176 Where am I?
6192355001895177 Of course I would. It can't get any worse anyway.
6192355001895178 I am a shepherd.
6192355001895179 A shame. I think I'm in need of a doctor. A good one. Better than myself...
6192355001895180 So you're shepherding me, huh?
6192355001895181 Home.
6192355001895182 This is not my home.
6192355001895183 I don't like this place.
6192355001895184 How do I get back to the town?
6192355001895185 Everything can change. Would you want it?
6192355001895186 Of course I would. Who wouldn't...
6192355001895187 No. I'm fine it as it is.
6192355001895188 Take a footpath. But you don't need to go there.
6192355001895189 Thank you. Farewell.

6192355001897866 Orderly No. 12. Arrived here at your behest, doc. I was there, by the fire. I see that you clearly are alive. Who cares what the legal papers say. It's not like I can read anyway...
6192355001897867 Are you the chief orderly?
6192355001897868 ...This is the first time in my life that I can appreciate the usefulness of illiteracy. Why no cloak though? Aren't you afraid of the infection?
6192355001897869 Nah. I'm a boatman. I used to take people across the river before the plague broke out.\nNow I'm here to keep on working, doc. I'm just standing my watch.
6192355001897870 All right. Have some rest. I can see you're on your last legs.
6192355001897871 Go. Your watch is over.
6192355001897872 Keep standing then...
6192355001897873 I am, doc. But I need my hands free...
6192355001897874 Whatever. It's too late now anyway.
6192355001897875 You're out of line, number twelve. If you leave this house, you'll have to put it on.
6192355001897876 Think 'tis time I began, eh, doc?
6192355001897877 Began what? It's all over now. We're done.
6192355001897878 Who are you?
6192355001897879 Orderly No. 12. Arrived here at your behest, doc. I was there, by the fire. I see that you clearly are alive. Who cares what the legal papers say. It's not like I can read anyway...
6192355001897880 You came too late.
6192355001897881 Why aren't you wearing a cloak?
6192355001897882 Well, what can one do... The bodies need to be moved around, that requires free hands. See, doc... There, uh... were people. Came seeking your help. You won't here, so, well... What can one do...
6192355001897883 Take the children to a spare room and board them off. Seal them shut so that not a single infected soul could get in. Got it?
6192355001897884 Then move the bodies wherever they need moving, number twelve. Be my guest...
6192355001897885 I'm doing my best to hurry, doctor, sir, I really am. Dismantling these bloody things takes time. But we're doing it.\nThey truly are disturbing.
6192355001897886 Are you dismantling signal fires? Why the hell? Who gave the order?
6192355001897887 Stop. Leave it.
6192355001897888 Erm... Well, it's not like anyone needs them anymore, sir. And it's getting colder by the day. October is at hand.\nMeans houses need heating. And wood is scarce in these parts... what with us living amidst a steppe and all.
6192355001897889 Leave it, I'm telling you.
6192355001897890 Don't you worry, you'll get warm in the evening when all the dead bodies will pile up and require moving around.
6192355001897891 You are indeed a learned and venerable man, sir... not one to indulge in superstition. But wouldn't we be croaking disaster if we keep them? Dismantling the unnerving things would be best. But it'll be as you wish, of course. I'm just following orders.
6192355001897892 I wish you would stop stepping out of line and prepare yourself for the worst.
6192355001897893 If no outbreak happens by the evening, you'll light it up to celebrate.
6192355001897894 Bite your tongue, doctor, sir! Erm, pardon me. But we've had enough dead bodies already, half the town is gone.\nThat's it. No more suffering. Now is the time to live.
6192355001897895 Half the town, huh? According to my information, you're severely underestimating the extent of the catastrophe.
6192355001897896 If you want to live, you have to listen to me! And I'm telling you that you're loosening safety measures prematurely.
6192355001897897 The fires turned out to be handy, doctor, sir! Your expectations came true. Truly, you have a brilliant mind.\nI've been asked to remind you of the appointment you have for today's evening. By God's mercy, perhaps it'll also go smoothly...
6192355001897898 Who are you?
6192355001897899 You've been asked? By whom? How do you know my appointments?
6192355001897900 I'm just standing my watch. Come, little birds, and gather around the marble nest!
6192355001897901 Damn you to hell.
6192355001897902 I've always hated marble...

6192355001928357 
6192355001928677 Hah! Thanks, Doc! You sure hit two birds with one stone there!
6192355001928678 What birds?
6192355001928679 You gave the sick over to the orderlies!\nMeans, first off, they won't suffer. Second, the residence can be freshened up, cleaned—and moved into, like new! Third, the orderlies are busy with them, so they won't touch us…\nThree birds, I suppose.
6192355001928680 Like hell you'll freshen up anything! That house needs to be burned down. Or at least boarded shut if fire isn't an option. And even then, never approached without protective clothes.
6192355001928681 Any particular reason for you to draw the orderlies' attention? Come closer, show me your tongue…
6192355001928682 Calm down, Doc! I'm fine. Just sayin'…
6192355001928683 "Just sayin'" doesn't seem to be working out all that brilliantly for you.
6192355001929016 Kindest sir! Fairy godfather!\nCan I call you "godfather" now…?
6192355001929017 What are you talking about, old man? I'm young enough to be your son.
6192355001929018 Please don't. My relations to the local people are purely professional.
6192355001929019 But it makes sense! You took us in… Sheltered us. Ordered to bring the sick to your own house! To close the eyes of the dying with your own hand, to give them final solace with your own prayer…
6192355001929020 It's not my house. It's a temporary residence. As for the sick, I was driven by rational considerations. Simpler this way.
6192355001929021 I truly hope I won't have to close anyone's eyes, and that my own hand will offer the patients broth and oats.
6192355001929022 Thank you… Thank you… They say that you don't have a heart, but I always knew that you do!
6192355001929023 An exquisite compliment indeed.
6192355001929024 If you only knew, old man…
6192355001929041 Ugh, I'm starving… Barely standing, too.
6192355001929042 Yes, I'm ravenous, too. Haven't had anything filling in a while… I think I'll faint if I don't eat in an hour.
6192355001929043 I'm sorry, but I don't have anything to share with you. If I gave you the bare necessities I have, I'd kick the bucket myself.
6192355001929113 …Now we burn the Cathedral down, right?\nIt's there you're heading, ain't it? To give the order?
6192355001929114 You're a fervent theomachist, I take it?
6192355001929115 No. We burn nothing down. We protect local architecture and execute arsonists. That's what we do. Got it?
6192355001929116 Well, I mean… You ordered everyone who so much as sniffled be dragged there, didn't you? Locked them up, let 'em stew, didn't you?\nStands to reason, I think, the only thing left to do is burn the place down and be done with the stinkin' sand pest.
6192355001929117 Commendable resolve. Do your friends share these ideas?
6192355001929118 I ordered <i>suspicious</i> people there, not the sick. To be tended to, not locked up. And don't get me started on the rest of your ideas!\nGive you people an inch of rope…
6192355001929122 Eh. The folks and I saved some kerosene for you. Need it?
6192355001929123 No. Go home and lock yourself in.
6192355001929124 Sorry, I have to go. Need to get to the Cathedral before your kind friends show up there with the kerosene.
6192355001929160 I think I should apologize for how angry we were at you… We thought the draconian security measures were put in place indefinitely.\nBut I've been told that the restrictions were canceled this morning. Does that imply unblocking the bridges too? Unnerving…
6192355001929161 "You've been told"? By whom?
6192355001929162 Keep being angry. The protective measures are here to stay. I even intend to tighten them.
6192355001929163 That's the rumor. The order came through this morning. Who could issue it? Obviously it was either you or Judge Kain—with your consent. Or maybe your assistants at the headquarters over at the Crucible. You must have had a hand in this… Are the rumors false, then?
6192355001929164 They must be. I ordered no such thing. Couldn't happen without my consent, either.
6192355001929165 The only world where they could be true is a world where I'm a sleepwalker who issued the orders in his sleep. Even then I wouldn't dream of it, really. In other words, this is nonsense.
6192355001929224 So what, we go back to work? With that stinkin' plague defeated an' all?\nMeans I have to return to the factory, is that it?
6192355001929225 What makes you say so?
6192355001929226 Isn't your factory across the river, in the very center of the outbreak?
6192355001929227 You're right. So how do I get back to work, then?
6192355001929228 Here's how: Go to the nearest soldier and explain you're a volunteer willing to fix barricades. Got it? Then off you are.
6192355001929267 Well, calamity's over, ain't it? Hence my questions an' all.
6192355001929268 If only it were so simple…
6192355001929269 Bored without work? Go to the Crucible, then. You'll find recruiters right outside, top of the stairs. Volunteer as an orderly. They'll give you the proper equipment.
6192355001929315 So will medicine be delivered by you now? I need spirits.
6192355001929316 Spirits to raise your spirits? No. Sanitizers cost their weight in gold now.
6192355001929317 What medicine are you talking about, old man? I don't even have the resources to properly dress a scratch.
6192355001929318 Resources are distributed by the headquarters, under the Judge's supervision. Haven't you been informed?
6192355001929319 So what of it, wasn't it you who ordered the drugstore locked up…? Us commonfolk are afraid to go there, never mind that it's on the outskirts.\nNo meds in the headquarters, no meds in possession. And them soldier lads won't give us none. So how do we get better? Ain't God's way, this.
6192355001929320 Why do you need medicine so badly? Let me look at your pupils…
6192355001929321 I never gave such an order. They're abusing their power. Thank you for voicing your concern.
6192355001929322 Come now, Doc! I'm healthy!\nOnly asking for my fellow man.
6192355001929323 Right. And to raise your spirits…
6192355001929324 No one in this town is healthy. Not in every sense of the word.
6192355001929351 The Crucible is off limits. The ark is full. Those who have been taken on board by the Judge will probably be saved. As for me, a mutt's death for a mutt. Dying in the street… Oh well. Ain't worse than dying anywhere.
6192355001929352 There are other places to seek shelter. The Cathedral, for example.
6192355001929353 Only those who don't bury themselves ahead of time will survive.
6192355001929386 Like anyone can find salvation in that place!
6192355001929387 …
6192355001929388 Nothing is over yet. This is just the beginning. I've been told to relay that to everyone.
6192355001929499 Doctor, you look exhausted! You need to take better care of yourself. I'd invite you to offer you dinner, but I've got nothing to share…
6192355001929500 You're quite right, I do need to eat. Don't worry, I'll find something.
6192355001929501 I'm sorry to hear that.
6192355001929557 They say the quarantine has been lifted. Are we free now? Is it permitted to cross the river?
6192355001929558 "They say" is half a lie. You shouldn't trust random rumors. The quarantine will only be lifted when I let it be lifted.
6192355001929559 "Across the river" equals "to a better world" these days, darling. Yes, you're free to go if you're in such a hurry.
6192355001929560 You should tell this to your beakheaded orderlies, then. They've abandoned their duties—meaning someone let them go.\nPeople expect the refugee shelters to be unlocked any moment now. They used to be our homes, after all. Is it true? When will it happen?
6192355001929561 This came out of the blue…
6192355001929562 …Over my dead body. The same applies to going across the river, too. Tell that to your friends.
6192355001929652 People were evicted from three houses yesterday. They must have left food behind. When is it going to be distributed?
6192355001929653 Evicted? How? Why?
6192355001929654 I suspect you are mistaken. Each household was provided three days worth of food for the isolation period. The bare minimum. So I very much doubt there's anything edible left anywhere.
6192355001929655 I don't know. But there may be goods inside, and those houses stand deserted anyway. So why won't they let us in?
6192355001929656 And where were the evicted people relocated, I wonder? It's not like there are spare houses in the Stone Yard. When we were trying to accommodate the refugees from across the river, people were packed like sardines. Some of them even had to sleep outside.
6192355001929657 Perhaps you're right, there may be food left there. I'll take a look. Which particular houses are you talking about? Who do they belong to?
6192355001929658 I don't know, doctor. It's said the owners have gone back across the river. The whole ordeal is over, isn't it? Doesn't this mean our own guests will also be evicted soon?
6192355001929659 I want to take a look personally. Where are these houses? They're guarded, I should hope?
6192355001929660 No. It won't happen anytime soon. You'll have to be patient.
6192355001929661 I don't know. Rumor has it, there are soldiers standing watch. Even if there's no food left, perhaps we can at least move refugees there?\nI mean really, Doctor! My own house is so packed, there's no room to swing a cat! And you've forbidden them from going outside, too…
6192355001929662 I've forbidden everyone from going outside. Yourself included. But my words seem to fall on deaf ears…
6192355001929663 Soldiers… Well, that's reassuring, at least. The last thing we need is looters.
6192355001929673 So, Dankovsky, did you find that thief of yours?
6192355001929674 What thief?
6192355001929675 "A thief of mine"? You must have taken me for someone else. I do not number thieves and pirates among my acquaintance.
6192355001929676 This night, a disheveled man broke into Judge Kain's house. Kicked up quite a racket…\nHe begged the Judge to hide him from you. Pleaded for justice. Everyone assumes he stole something from you.
6192355001929677 He asked the Judge for justice? I wonder if he expects me to shoot first and ask questions later.
6192355001929678 So lovely of him to go straight to a judge after that. It's nice to see people of high moral values.
6192355001929679 I don't know. Perhaps. He must have had his reasons.
6192355001929680 …Ah! I see. I think I know why that man was scared of me. I suspect I've found what I've been looking for.
6192355001929681 I'm a doctor, not a criminal. If I caught a thief, I would most likely offer him food and shelter.
6192355001929682 Perhaps… I think a visit to the Judge is in order.
6192355001929856 When a person lives in one place for a long time, they imbue it with their soul. Even after they die, the particles remain, filling the place.\nIt's good you locked down the houses of the deceased, and forbid anyone from moving in there.
6192355001929857 Who told you that? I'm very much in favor of resettlement.
6192355001929858 As if there were tenants to move in…
6192355001929859 The tenant of the Stillwater died some time ago and was never infected, yet her mansion remains untouched. Thank you!\nWhen I walk by it, I sometimes hear her voice. That means that everything is all right.
6192355001929860 Never been better.
6192355001929861 It can't be. You're imagining things.
6192355001929897 Have you ever considered going to a fortune-teller? To learn your fate, maybe even see tomorrow?
6192355001929898 Palmistry, tarot, reading entrails? I don't appreciate obscurantism.
6192355001929899 No. Never. Remember Macbeth?
6192355001929900 No. These kinds of people always try to astonish the audience by predicting their date of death. And in my case, they'd be mistaken.
6192355001929901 Any help or advice would be appreciated now. Even that from an augur or a haruspex.
6192355001929902 A mime performance is being staged in front of the Cathedral. A tragic one.\nThe actors are, not unexpectedly, quite silent, but if you manage to get one to talk…
6192355001929903 A tragic performance that will predict my fate? Sounds reassuring.
6192355001929904 Tragic, huh? Indeed, it must be hard to watch the local attempts at drama without weeping,
6192355001929905 Don't worry. You'll like it.
6192355001929906 Like I would worry about some backwater theatre.
6192355001929907 I hope they return the money if the audience hasn't experienced catharsis…
6192355001929948 It's been three days and we're yet to see a single sick person here in the Stone Yard. To think that the plague was spreading like wildfire before! Yet somehow you managed to stop it… Incredible.
6192355001929949 Don't give all the credit to me. A lot of people worked their fingers to the bone helping out.
6192355001929950 There's nothing to be incredulous about. Diligent measures, unflinching control, strict discipline… That's all it takes.
6192355001930051 Earth and the Middle were more crowded… and chaotic. Working here was much easier.
6192355001930118 Have you seen them? Rats everywhere, thousands of rats! What does it mean…? It can't be here already, can it?
6192355001930119 Calm down! It doesn't mean anything yet.
6192355001930120 I have… To think that I almost believed that we may have indeed won. Idiot!
6192355001930524 Why didn't you take in the boy? He'll become an urchin now.\nDon't you realize what he'll turn into? What he'll be doing in a week's time?
6192355001930525 What boy?
6192355001930526 You examined the late Blacker. But you didn't bother with the fate of his stepson.
6192355001930527 I'll be thrilled if he's still alive to engage in petty thievery in a week's time.
6192355001930528 I'm a doctor, not a sister of mercy. Urchins and orphans are the local authorities' responsibility.
6192355001930529 He's probably smashing someone's windows right now. Who will reimburse that damage? You?
6192355001930530 You're a moron. Out of my way!
6192355001930531 Please address your concerns about broken windows to the headquarters at the Crucible or the Judge personally. As for your stunning lack of consideration, do find a confessor.
6192355001930576 Please allow me to shake your hand.
6192355001930577 To what do I owe the pleasure?
6192355001930578 I was mistaken about you. You are the only brave person in this town.
6192355001930579 I'm flattered.
6192355001930580 Are you trying to borrow money from me or something?
6192355001930581 A maneater should never pretend to be a mouse. He should wield his bloodstained cleaver proudly. Issuing the order regarding the suspects in the Cathedral was a straightforward and candid action.\nHopefully you witnessed the… display… in person?
6192355001930582 I gave no such order.
6192355001930583 Do you think doing my duty is fun?
6192355001930584 What display?
6192355001930585 Stop trying to wriggle your way out. There's nothing more nauseating than a person attempting to cast away their vocation.\nA natural-born hangman makes for a lousy rope weaver. Just work with the material fate gives you.
6192355001930586 Go to hell.
6192355001930614 By the Cathedral. You ought to have a look.
6192355001930615 I have no idea what you're talking about.
6192355001930672 What do you call a person who first announces that the epidemic is curbed and then immediately sets up hospital in their very house?
6192355001930673 I'd call such a person diligent and considerate.
6192355001930674 Brave.
6192355001930675 I'd call him human and thus capable of making mistakes. For example, just now he mistook you for a decent person. Farewell.
6192355001930676 And I'd call them a two-faced viper who fed people false hope.
6192355001930677 It's better to take hope away when catastrophe looms than to cling to illusions, leading everyone to their graves.
6192355001930678 Let us rejoice, then: No one has asked for your opinion.
6192355001930679 No. It is not.
6192355001930680 Whatever,
6192355001930689 A hungry soldier is a lousy soldier. Man does nothing right on an empty stomach. When are they going to open the shops again? When will food be distributed?
6192355001930690 Oh, thanks for reminding me. I think I need to have a bite… or else I might faint of hunger.
6192355001930691 I don't know. Deal with it.
6192355001930762 I think I should apologize for how angry we were at you… We thought the draconian security measures were put in place indefinitely.\nBut I've been told that the restrictions were canceled this morning. Does that imply unblocking the bridges too? Unnerving…"
6192355001930763 "You've been told"? By whom?
6192355001930764 Keep being angry. The protective measures are here to stay. I even intend to tighten them.
6192355001930765 That's the rumor. The order came through this morning. Who could issue it? Obviously it was either you or Judge Kain—with your consent. Or maybe your assistants at the headquarters over at the Crucible. You must have had a hand in this… Are the rumors false, then?
6192355001930766 They must be. I ordered no such thing. Couldn't happen without my consent, either.
6192355001930767 The only world where they could be true is a world where I'm a sleepwalker who issued the orders in his sleep. Even then I wouldn't dream of it, really. In other words, this is nonsense.
6192355001930870 A masquerade ball will be held in the main square this evening. People want to celebrate our victory over the sand pest. You don't mind…?
6192355001930871 Of course I do. Is the average age in this town five?
6192355001930872 How about burying your dead first? People want to celebrate, my ass…
6192355001930873 I seem to vaguely remember a rather famous story about a masquerade held to celebrate a victory over a plague. Remember how it ended?
6192355001930922 Religious buildings often have thick walls. Why, I wonder? So that the holy spirit won't flutter out?
6192355001930923 Monasteries often serve as prisons.
6192355001930924 Do not blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. Even I know that, and I'm agnostic.
6192355001930925 So that worldly desires won't creep in.
6192355001930937 In any case, it works in your favor. Thick walls contain moans and screams effectively.\nThis is why you ordered to drag everyone suspicious to the Cathedral, isn't it? So that everything would seem fine from the outside?
6192355001930938 No cheating your eagle eye though.
6192355001930939 No. The people who show suspicious signs are taken to the Cathedral because no one in the Town attends the place.
6192355001930966 If I were you, I'd hurry up with the inspection. One day, so many people will be mured up there that the walls won't be able to hold.
6192355001930967 What would I do without your sagely advice?
6192355001930968 I'll check on the place.
6192355001930989 Time is coming to an end. But that's fine. We'll manage without it just fine.
6192355001930990 Clearly you have no appreciation of how the world works. All of you. An insane, disjointed town!
6192355001930991 What?
6192355001931031 It has all been in vain. The plague has gotten to us here. The Neck and Mallet districts are already poisoned.
6192355001931032 Don't give up. There were survivors across the river. Seven, I believe. That's a lot.
6192355001931033 This is all your fault. I did everything I could.
6192355001931048 Doctor, did you know that a terrified man snuck into Judge Kain's place this night? He begged the Judge to hide him.
6192355001931049 Hide? From whom?
6192355001931050 What scared the poor soul so much?
6192355001931151 I don't care. The Judge has every right to invite whoever he pleases to his house.
6192355001931152 …He implored the Judge to hide and protect him from you, Doctor.
6192355001931153 …And? Did the Judge agree?
6192355001931154 Curious… So this is why the Judge wanted to see me this morning.
6192355001931155 Well, I don't know the details. I just thought I should tell…\nI'm not an informer. But now is not the time for secrets. Too much is at stake, wouldn't you agree?
6192355001931156 Absolutely. You did the right thing.
6192355001931157 Thank you, kind sir. Let us hope the Judge refused to hide the man. That would simplify my search a lot.
6192355001931158 You know, you really shouldn't have done this. It's hard to respect a snitch, however valuable his information.
6192355001931360 You look ready to drop, Doctor. Why do you refuse to take care of yourself? When was the last time you had a bite to eat?
6192355001931361 I don't remember… You're right, I probably should.
6192355001931362 Touching. Now please mind your own business and move along.
6192355001931438 People were evicted from three houses yesterday. They must have left food behind. When is it going to be distributed?
6192355001931439 Evicted? How? Why?
6192355001931440 I suspect you are mistaken. Each household was provided three days worth of food for the isolation period. The bare minimum. So I very much doubt there's anything edible left anywhere.
6192355001931444 I don't know. But there may be goods inside, and those houses stand deserted anyway. So why won't they let us in?
6192355001931445 And where were the evicted people relocated, I wonder? It's not like there are spare houses in the Stone Yard. When we were trying to accommodate the refugees from across the river, people were packed like sardines. Some of them even had to sleep outside.
6192355001931446 Perhaps you're right, there may be food left there. I'll take a look. Which particular houses are you talking about? Who do they belong to?
6192355001931447 I don't know, doctor. It's said the owners have gone back across the river. The whole ordeal is over, isn't it? Doesn't this mean our own guests will also be evicted soon?
6192355001931448 I want to take a look personally. Where are these houses? They're guarded, I should hope?
6192355001931449 No. It won't happen anytime soon. You'll have to be patient.
6192355001931450 I don't know. Rumor has it, there are soldiers standing watch. Even if there's no food left, perhaps we can at least move refugees there?\nI mean really, Doctor! My own house is so packed, there's no room to swing a cat! And you've forbidden them from going outside, too…
6192355001931451 I've forbidden everyone from going outside. Yourself included. But my words seem to fall on deaf ears…
6192355001931452 Soldiers… Well, that's reassuring, at least. The last thing we need is looters.
6192355001931453 Thank you for lifting the quarantine, Doctor. This means we've managed to outlive the worst, doesn't it? No more suffering?
6192355001931454 What do you mean "lifting the quarantine"? I did no such thing.
6192355001931455 Not only have I not lifted it, I'm planning to tighten security measures.
6192355001931456 Oh… But the soldiers abandoned the square—I saw them leave myself. They say the shop reopened… Those terrible orderlies, disbanded… Rumor has it, an order came through, canceling your prior instructions.
6192355001931457 This is absurd. You've been misinformed, good lady.
6192355001931458 Who could have issued such an order? As far as I know, neither Judge Kain nor the people in the anti-epidemic committee are prone to sabotage.
6192355001931489 My husband's been dragged to the isolation ward in the Cathedral. He needs to be let go, Doctor!\nWhy are people still confined there? There's no need for them to be, what with the disease having been eliminated and all!
6192355001931490 There is a need, dear. A pressing one, at that. This is the only way to prevent infection from spreading. So don't pester me with this issue.
6192355001931491 The orderlies are keeping your best interests at heart.
6192355001931492 You shameless butchers! You've seized my husband, and a dozen more with him… Perfectly healthy people! Pure as the driven snow!\nMy husband doesn't even get colds! His cough is due to the coal dust. He works at the railroad station!
6192355001931493 Well, clearly if he's invulnerable to colds, the sand plague isn't a threat to him, either. Get off my back.
6192355001931494 I can't make exceptions. The rules are the same for everyone. <i>Dura lex, sed lex.</i>
6192355001931527 I've gambled my soul away.
6192355001931528 Now that's a stake…
6192355001931529 So who has it now?
6192355001931530 Oh! And where do they gamble for souls? I'd like to have a word with the owner of the establishment.
6192355001931531 They left their stupid Theatre behind, across the river, and now idle away at the square in front of the bloody Cathedral. I wonder how they got here in the first place…?\nBut they won't accept your bet. To each their own, as the saying goes…
6192355001931532 Keep your chin up, my friend. You've been swindled—there's nothing more to it. It's not so easy to extract a person's soul.
6192355001931533 True. To each their own.
6192355001931534 Oh, you managed to prevail over the sand plague. If not for you, we'd all be six feet under.\nDoesn't this mean the worst is over? The infection won't come back…?
6192355001931535 You are safe as long as you follow my instructions. For one, I ordered everyone to stay in and refrain from aimless wandering.
6192355001931536 Epidemics are timeless. Of course it will come back someday.

6192355001931653 They'll open it when I tell them to. Not a minute earlier, not a minute later.
6192355001931654 There are soldiers at the drugstore…? Interesting. Well, they probably have a reason to be there.
6192355001931655 How in the world did you even arrive at this conclusion? Truly, folk logic works in mysterious ways.
6192355001931656 That's what you think. You probably even believe the soldiers still follow your orders…\nHa! Like they'd give you a single pill! Go check for yourself if you don't believe me.
6192355001931657 I'd like to watch them try and stop me. It's not they who protect my life now; it's the other way round. I'm sure they can appreciate that.
6192355001931658 The soldiers follow Captain Longin's orders. Or General Block's, if by some miracle he got better… which I doubt. Sand plague is incurable.
6192355001931659 What will become of us?
6192355001931660 Nothing good. Prepare for death.
6192355001931661 Don't give up. Live, as long as you can. Apathy and fear are the deadliest killers.

6192355001933220 General Block's headquarters used to be here.

6192355001933222 Var was taken to a talk with Captain Longin soon after the Army arrived.

6192355001933231 The Trammel

6192355001938951 
6192355001938952 You need to push your limits. You are shackled now. Caged. Defy the laws of this cage.
6192355001938953 Easier said than done...
6192355001938954 Yeah, right... "The body is a prison", everything is but an illusion... Spare me the clichéd preaching, will you?
6192355001938955 ...I'm scared.
6192355001938956 Most importantly, don't be scared. Go in without fear. Concentrate on yourself.
6192355001938957 Am I dying?
6192355001938958 What do I do?
6192355001938959 That's not what I meant. And in any case, don't you think that this idea is clichéd precisely because so many people come to realize its truthfulness? You don't really have a choice. You have heard my words; now you need to understand how they apply to you personally... you alone.
6192355001938960 Indeed. I'm alone.
6192355001938961 To think I was hoping you could offer some real help...
6192355001938962 You're too early. Not everyone's here yet.
6192355001938963 What are you doing here?
6192355001938964 Are we expecting someone?
6192355001938965 What was that... beast? How did it get here?
6192355001938966 Tidying up... Preparing the house for your return.
6192355001938967 Well, I've returned. Here I am. So you are free to go.
6192355001938968 The main guest is yet to come. Don't shoo me away, Bachelor. I'll help you entertain it.
6192355001938969 I'm not shooing anyone. The principles of hospitality are not to be disregarded.
6192355001938970 This place isn't mine, I'm just staying here temporarily. You can do whatever you want.
6192355001938971 Disregard him. That's my pet. He's here to pull the carriage.
6192355001938972 Silly me, missing such an obvious explanation.
6192355001938973 What? What carriage?
6192355001938974 
6192355001940051

6192355001941953 A person is only alive for as long as they feel pain. No matter what Katerina Saburova does, she remains alive.

6192355001949454 There's something strange going on at the Bridge Square.
6192355001949851 The Judge is actively sabotaging my efforts in fighting the Sand Pest.
6192355001949852 [Все уже изменилось, и теперь тебе надо принять это изменение или кануть в Лету, your choice]\n
6192355001949853 [Huzzah?]
6192355001950151 I think it's starting already. Shall we go?
6192355001950152 Who is being laid to rest?
6192355001950153 …What is that horrible toll?
6192355001950154 Where?
6192355001950155 A doctor from the Capital. He was a brilliant man.
6192355001950156 I am the doctor from the Capital. And, as you can plainly see, I'm quite alive.
6192355001950157 Not funny.
6192355001950158 I thought I was the only doctor around here… from the Capital, at least.\nBurakh is a local. Clara doesn't even count.
6192355001950159 Funeral bells. Time to go.
6192355001950160 So someone has died… Someone important, I've gathered?
6192355001950161 I don't remember even the most noble townsfolk being laid to rest in such an ostentatious fashion.
6192355001950162 He passed away in his own bed. So now we're going to his place to pay our final respects.
6192355001950163 …
6192355001950164 All right. I'll be there, too.
6192355001950165 Well… That means we part ways here.
6192355001953351 This house is heavily guarded. Something's going on in there.
6192355001954951 Headquarters is located here.
6192355001960151 This house is guarded.

6192355001961556 
6192355001961557 
6192355001961951 Indeed? Did you consider it well?\nIt's neither a joke nor a dream. You're making a real choice now.
6192355001961952 Indeed. I always say precisely what I intend to.
6192355001961954 It was just a joke.
6192355001961955 Not the first. I'm looking everywhere.
6192355001962451 It's time for me to return home. Whatever happens, I need some rest.
6192355001963151 The pharmacy is closed and guarded. But an enterprising kid suggested to hide everything I throw out of the window on the second floor—and share the loot.
6192355001963251 It's time for me to return home. I should contemplate today's events.
6192355001963252 It's time for me to return home. My presence is expected.
6192355001963671 The wedding went well. This is for you. No declining.
6192355001963672 ...
6192355001963673 Is that her heart? That girl's? The one who danced...?
6192355001963674 ...Wrap it well. Otherwise it would be uncomfortable for me to walk in public.
6192355001963675 No declining. She chose. Herself.\nShe was betrothed to the earth. The wedding went well.
6192355001963676 Oh, I'm not declining. This is evidence. The soldiers will surely prefer me to offer some.
6192355001963677 You know what... I'm beginning to think the plague broke out here for a reason.\nI shouldn't have bothered fighting it.
6192355001963678 A lovely wedding...
6192355001963679 Go. You're disturbing her mourning.
6192355001963680 I wanted to offer my condolences once again. Such a loss on a wedding day...
6192355001963681 Is that mourning? You steppe people truly have it backwards.
6192355001963682 You don't know what she lost. Go.
6192355001963683 I'd like to find out then. Let me through!
6192355001963684 ...Just relay my condolences to her, will you?
6192355001963685 No.
6192355001963686 To hell with you all then.
6192355001963687 Just relay my condolences to her.
6192355001964851 
6192355001964852

6192355001970051 
6192355001976351 I came too late. I'll never know what killed the man.
6192355001976352 I cannot diagnose the couple in the Cathedral, but I do know they weren't the main carriers.
6192355001976353 I don't know why I even bother. I've already figured out it wasn't the steppe people who brought the plague into the Stone Yard.
6192355001976354 It can't be changed now. The Town is done for.
6192355001976551 
6192355001979951 I see. I'll pay them a visit.
6192355001980451 
6192355001980452 
6192355001980453 
6192355001980454 
6192355001983151 I'm sorry, but I can't just let you die. If you're infected, I need to keep you here as proof that I'm right about the new outbreak. I'm locking you in.
6192355001983152 I see no obvious signs of infection. But have it your way-I'd rather you stayed here. That would be for the better.
6192355001984463 
6192355001984464 
6192355001984465 
6192355001984466 
6192355001984651 He did manage to find a cure, after all.
6192355001984652 
6192355001987051 Charm
6192355001987052 Believed to avert bad fortune. The result speaks for itself.
6192355001987053 You can't craft good fortune; such a fickle mistress must be charmed.
6192355001987054 Neomycinum
6192355001987055 Lowers infection, but doesn't completely heal the patient.
6192355001987056 The only certain way to prevent infection is to drop dead. Antibiotics help with both, since they lower infection <i>and</i> harm the patient.
6192355001987057 Neomycinum (+)
6192355001987058 Lowers infection, but doesn't completely heal the patient. Potent.
6192355001987059 The only certain way to prevent infection is to drop dead. Antibiotics help with both, since they lower infection <i>and</i> harm the patient. This one is an even more efficient killer than the rest.
6192355001987060 Ferromycinum
6192355001987061 Lowers infection, but doesn't completely heal the patient.
6192355001987062 The only certain way to prevent infection is to drop dead. Antibiotics help with both, since they lower infection <i>and</i> harm the patient.
6192355001987063 Ferromycinum (+)

6192355001987072 Apple
6192355001987073 Not very fresh, but will still satisfy a little hunger and thirst.
6192355001987074 We'll grow apple tree gardens in the desert yet.
6192355001987075 Bracelet
6192355001987076 A trinket for ladies.
6192355001987077 Local trinkets are rather primitive.
6192355001987078 Chalk
6192355001987079 With these, children draw their future towns on the cobblestones.
6192355001987080 Anyone who's been a student will recognize the smell anywhere.
6192355001987081 Shoes
6192355001987082 Worn and unimpressive.
6192355001987083 I've worn down three pairs of shoes getting here… and nearly as many running trivial errands for the local rulers. Ugh.
6192355001987084 Egg
6192355001987085 A serviceable snack. The chicken is nowhere to be found.
6192355001987086 To understand anything, start <i>ab ovo</i>—"from the egg."
6192355001987087 Empty Bottle
6192355001987088 Can be filled with water.
6192355001987089 "I love glass. Everything good comes in glasses."
6192355001987090 Hazelnuts
6192355001987091 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355001987092 A Focus can be held by an object of any size: a Polyhedron, a room, a nut.
6192355001987093 Smoked Fish
6192355001987094 Salty. Spicy. Smells delicious, never spoils, and causes ravaging thirst.
6192355001987095 Good rations for people always on the road. Perhaps that's because fish never stop, either.
6192355001987096 Steppe Kashk
6192355001987097 A dry, fermented dairy product… I guess.
6192355001987098 While herding cows and bulls in the steppe, steppemen often live on this "kashk" for months at a time.\n\nNever tried it before. Not tasty, but now isn't the time to be picky.
6192355001987099 Lemon
6192355001987100 Eating a lot of lemons is bad for your teeth. They won't make you less hungry, but they're certainly an invigorating fruit.
6192355001987101 When life gives you lemons…
6192355001987102 Lockpick
6192355001987103 A tool to open ordinary doors. Children make them from random trash.
6192355001987104 These lockpicks are better than the kind the locals would stick into each other's' guts, before the second decree of the late governor Saburov.
6192355001987105 Master Key
6192355001987106 Shoddy. Will likely break after opening a few ordinary doors.
6192355001987107 The locals don't bother with security much. Until recently, most doors stood wide open…
6192355001987108 Name on Paper
6192355001987109 For some reason I keep finding scraps of paper all over the Town that have names written on them.
6192355001987110 I am Daniil Dankovsky, a Bachelor of Medicine and fighter of death. I have one last chance to figure out the truth.
6192355001987111 Needle
6192355001987112 As piercing as a wise person's stare. Can be used to pick small locks, such as the ones in cabinet drawers.
6192355001987113 I'm more used to syringe needles—empty inside.
6192355001987114 Steppe Pemmican
6192355001987115 A mixture of meat, fruit, and fat. Extremely filling, only slightly revolting.
6192355001987116 Pemmican isn't eaten for pleasure. This form preserves meat and fat for the weeks steppe people spend herding bulls on the grasslands.
6192355001987117 Ring
6192355001987118 It circles back, like Saturday. Equally precious.
6192355001987119 "Ding-a-ding,\nHear the ring ring…"
6192355001987120 Safety Pin
6192355001987121 Both safe and unsafe at the same time.
6192355001987122 Useful to patch up old, out-of-order dolls.
6192355001987123 Thimble
6192355001987124 Useless in a town that forbids sharp objects.
6192355001987125 I've seen one just like it not so long ago… but I don't remember where.
6192355001989651 White Whip
6192355001989652 A steppe herb with a bitter odor. Makes my eyes water.
6192355001989653 Local herbs possess unexpected pharmaceutical properties. Even untreated, their odor undoubtedly has odd effects on people's health. Small wonder everyone's… <i>like this</i> in the Town.
