### Big steps to take are:
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character spawns
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters

Right now I want to figure out how to make a new character with new model (based on static 2d illustration), and figure out how to enter forced dialog with them.
