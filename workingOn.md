### Big steps to take are:
* figuring out how to alter scenes and character spawns
* figuring out how to make new items and add item effects
* figuring out how to create and add new characters

Right now I want to figure out how to make a character spawn at a new time. 
Specifically, I want Rubin to appear in his house at Midnight day 2. Right now, he appears at 7:30 on the Day 2 morning. I want him to spawn in the same spot, same animation etc.
